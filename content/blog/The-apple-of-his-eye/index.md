There are some Bible verses describing God's people as the apple of His eye:  

Psalm 17:8, Deuteronomy 32:10

Deuteronomy ‬32:9-13 NLT  
9 “For the people of Israel belong to the Lord;   
Jacob is his special possession.  
10 He found them in a desert land, in an empty, howling waste land.   
He surrounded them and watched over them;   
he guarded them as he would guard his own eyes.  
11 Like an eagle that rouses her chicks and hovers over her young,   
so he spread his wings to take them up and carried them safely on his pinions.  
12 The Lord alone guided them;   
they followed no foreign gods.  
13 He let them ride over the highlands and feast on the crops of the fields.   
He nourished them with honey from the rock and olive oil from the stony ground.  

9 耶和华的份本是他的百姓；  
他的产业本是雅各。  

10耶和华遇见他在旷野  
荒凉野兽吼叫之地，  
就环绕他，看顾他，  
保护他，如同保护眼中的瞳人。  
11又如鹰搅动巢窝，  
在雏鹰以上两翅搧展，  
接取雏鹰，背在两翼之上。  
12这样，耶和华独自引导他，  
并无外邦神与他同在。  
13耶和华使他乘驾地的高处，  
得吃田间的土产；  
又使他从磐石中咂蜜，  
从坚石中吸油；

There are some Bible verses describing His word as the apple of His eye:  

‪Proverbs‬7:2 NLT  
2 Obey my commands and live!   
Guard my instructions as you guard your own eyes.  

2遵守我的命令就得存活；  
保守我的法则（或作“指教”），  
好像保守眼中的瞳人，
