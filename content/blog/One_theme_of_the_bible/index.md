The God's will is:  

1) to refine us like pure silver;  

2) to make us as if a potter makes a vessel out of clay; ï¼ˆJeremiah 18:1-10, Jeremiah 18-20, Isaiah 64:8-9, 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12)  

3) to build us, not to destroy us; (Jeremiah 1:10)  

4) to carry our cross and walk with the Lord;  

5) to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize; (Philippians 3:12-14)
