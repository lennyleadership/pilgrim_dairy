<li>“But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.”(NLT) (see 2 Thessalonians 3:3 ESV)</li> 
<li>“God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”(NLT) (see 1 Corinthians 1:9 ESV)</li>
<li>“But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.”(NLT) (see 1 John 1:9 ESV)</li>
“Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.”(NLT) (see Revelation 19:11 ESV)</li>
<li>“God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble. So we will not fear when earthquakes come and the mountains crumble into the sea. Let the oceans roar and foam. Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge! Interlude”(NLT) (see Psalm 46:1-3 ESV)</li>
<li>“The Lord will not reject his people; he will not abandon his special possession.”(NLT) (see Psalm 94:14 ESV)</li> 
<li>“The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives. Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand. Once I was young, and now I am old. Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned or their children begging for bread.”(NLT) (see Psalm 37:23-25 ESV)</li> 
<li>“The Lord is a shelter for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. Those who know your name trust in you, for you, O Lord, do not abandon those who search for you.”(NLT) (see Psalm 9:9-10 ESV)</li>
<li>“God is not a man, so he does not lie. He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act? Has he ever promised and not carried it through?”(NLT) (see Numbers 23:19 ESV)</li>
<li>“Yet I still dare to hope when I remember this: The faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies never cease. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning. I say to myself, “The Lord is my inheritance; therefore, I will hope in him!” The Lord is good to those who depend on him, to those who search for him. So it is good to wait quietly for salvation from the Lord.”(NLT) (see Lamentations 3:21-26 ESV)</li> 
<li>“He is the Rock; his deeds are perfect. Everything he does is just and fair. He is a faithful God who does no wrong; how just and upright he is!”(NLT) (see Deuteronomy 32:4 ESV)</li> 
<li>“God will make this happen, for he who calls you is faithful.”(NLT) (see 1 Thessalonians 5:24 ESV)</li>
<li>“Not a single one of all the good promises the Lord had given to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled; everything he had spoken came true.”(NLT) (see Joshua 21:45 ESV)</li>
<li>“The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.”(NLT) (see 2 Peter 3:9 ESV)</li>
<li>“Understand, therefore, that the Lord your God is indeed God. He is the faithful God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing love on those who love him and obey his commands.”(NLT) (see Deuteronomy 7:9 ESV)</li>
