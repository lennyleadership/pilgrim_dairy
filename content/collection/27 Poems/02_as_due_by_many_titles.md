As Due by Many Titles

- John Donne  

As due by many titles I resign  
&emsp;Myself to thee, O God. First I was made  
&emsp;By Thee; and for Thee, and when I was decay'd  
Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine.  
I am Thy son, made with Thyself to shine,  
&emsp;Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,  
&emsp;Thy sheep, Thine image, and—till I betray'd  
Myself—a temple of Thy Spirit divine.  
Why doth the devil then usurp on me?  
&emsp;Why doth he steal, nay ravish, that's Thy right?  
Except Thou rise and for Thine own work fight,  
&emsp;O! I shall soon despair, when I shall see  
That Thou lovest mankind well, yet wilt not choose me,  
And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me.

我本有众多名分    

约翰·多恩  


我本有众多名分，表明

&emsp;我属你，哦，上帝。起初，我为你

&emsp;所造，因你受造，我尚在罪中，

你就用宝血买赎，原本属你之物。

我是你的子，你创造我发光如星，

&emsp;我是你的仆，你代替我偿还罪债，

&emsp;我是你的羊、你的形象——可我自甘堕落

我——又是你的灵居住的殿宇。

为什么魔鬼强占了我？

&emsp;为什么他偷窃甚至掠夺那属于你的权力？

若不是你起来，为你亲手所造而战，

&emsp;哦！我就会坠入绝望，因我会想

你爱众人至深，却不拣选我，

撒旦如此恨我，却舍不得将我丢弃。

The [speaker](https://poemanalysis.com/diction/speaker-in-poetry/), who is commonly considered to be Donne himself, is talking to God about his soul and his future. He’s lived a sinful life and knows his mistakes have led him to Satan. Now, in *‘Holy [Sonnet](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-form/sonnet/) II,’* he’s seeking a path away from the sin he’s been so focused on.


Holy Sonnet II  
John Donne  

As due by many titles I resign  
Myself to thee, O God. First I was made  
By Thee; and for Thee, and when I was decay’d  
Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine.  
I am Thy son, made with Thyself to shine,  
Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,  
Thy sheep, Thine image, and—till I betray’d  
Myself—a temple of Thy Spirit divine.  
Why doth the devil then usurp on me?  
Why doth he steal, nay ravish, that’s Thy right?  
Except Thou rise and for Thine own work fight,  
O! I shall soon despair, when I shall see  
That Thou lovest mankind well, yet wilt not choose me,  
And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me.




## Summary

*‘Holy Sonnet II’* by John Donne describes one speaker’s concern that he won’t be able to return to God’s good graces.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing how devoted he is to God and describing how he feels that God made him in his image. The speaker is dedicated to God, but he’s lived a sinful life. This is something he’s well aware of and which he’s trying to atone for. But, he worries that he doesn’t have enough time to escape Satan’s grasp.

## Themes

The main theme of this poem is sin. It is coupled with the speaker’s need to repent. He’s a faithful person, something that becomes clear in the first few lines. But, he’s lived a sinful life. He’s done a great deal that he’s now ashamed of. But, he’s having trouble removing himself from Satan’s grasp. He’s concerned that, with the limited time he has left on Earth, he won’t be able to atone for everything he’s done and return to God.

## Structure and Form

*‘Holy Sonnet II’* by John Donne is a fourteen-line poem that follows a [rhyme scheme](https://poemanalysis.com/definition/rhyme-scheme/) of <mark class = "lemon">ABBABBACDDCCC</mark>. This slightly unusual [rhyme](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/rhyme/) scheme uses the traditional pattern of a [Petrarchan sonnet](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-form/petrarchan-sonnet/) in the first eight lines and an interesting variation in the final six lines. The poet also chose to structure this poem in [iambic pentameter](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-meter/iambic-pentameter/). This means that the lines contain five sets of two beats the first of which is unstressed and the second of which is stressed. This is the common metrical pattern used in [sonnets](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-form/sonnet/).

## Literary Devices

Throughout this poem, the poet makes use of several literary devices. These include but are not limited to:

- **[Caesura](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/caesura/)**: [a pause](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/caesura/) in the middle of a line of [verse](https://poemanalysis.com/definition/verse/) because of the poet’s use of punctuation or a natural pause in the [meter](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-meter/meter/). For example, “Thy sheep, Thine image, and—till I betray’d.”
- **[Alliteration](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/alliteration/)**: the [repetition](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/repetition/) of the same consonant sound at the beginning of multiple words. For example, “blood bought” and “doth” and “devil.”
- **[Enjambment](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/enjambment/)**: a [transition](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/transition/) between two lines that does not use end-punctation and leaves a phrase incomplete. For example, the transition between lines one and two as well as lines twelve and thirteen.
- **[Allusion](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/allusion/)**: a reference to something not explained within the text of a poem. For example, this poem is filled with religious references seen through the poet’s address to God.

## Detailed Analysis

### Lines 1-4

> As due by many titles I resign [A]
> 
> Myself to thee, O God. First I was made [B]

In the first lines of *‘Holy Sonnet II,’* the poet’s speaker begins the poem by addressing God. He tells God that he wants to give himself over entirely. His mind and body are both dedicated to God’s will. He was made for God, and by God, he adds.

### Lines 5-8

> I am Thy son, made with Thyself to shine, [A]
> 
> Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid, [B]
> 
> Thy sheep, Thine image, and — till I betray’d [B]
> 
> Myself — a temple of Thy Spirit divine. [A]
> 

In the second [quatrain](https://poemanalysis.com/poetic-form/quatrain/), the speaker provides readers with more images that help create a full understanding of how the speaker sees his relationship with God. He is a child of God, as are all human beings. He is made from God and therefore contains within him some of the shining divinity that God is defined by.

He’s also God’s servant, he says. But, he’s sinned in his life and betrayed himself, which he called “a temple of Thy Spirit divine.” Until he sinned, he was a perfect [embodiment](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/personification/) of God.

### Lines 9-14

> Why doth the devil then usurp on me? [C]
> 
> Why doth he steal, nay ravish, that’s Thy right? [D]
> 
> Except Thou rise and for Thine own work fight, [D]
> 
> O! I shall soon despair, when I shall see [C]
> 
> That Thou lovest mankind well, yet wilt not choose me, [C]
> 
> And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me. [C]
> 

In the next few lines, the speaker asks two [rhetorical questions](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/rhetorical-question/). He suggests that the devil has come into his life and removed from his soul the perfect goodness that God imbued him with. His shining divine soul has been corrupted and “ravish[ed]” by the devil.

The speaker worries that unless his better side reveals itself, or the parts of himself that are still good and Godly, he’ll completely stray from the correct path.

The poem concludes with the speaker saying that he’s worried or is soon to despair if he can’t atone for his past sins. He’ll despair if he’s not reunited with God, he adds, despite the fact that he knows God loves humankind.

The last line says Satan hates him but is unwilling to release the speaker from his grasp.
