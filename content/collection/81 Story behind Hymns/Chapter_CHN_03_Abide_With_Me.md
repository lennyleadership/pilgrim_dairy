十九世纪一位英国圣公会的牧师亨利‧赖特，他把一生奉献给主，在事奉的过程中，屡经挫折，身体也不好。晚年他在一个偏僻穷困的渔村服事，那些渔夫无知又粗暴，经常给他带来很多困扰。那时，正接近他传道生涯最后的日子，教会却莫名其妙出现很多纷争，信徒之间彼此恼恨。他一生爱主，服事主，但所作的仿佛被信徒之间的不和而给抹灭了。他一生的事奉好像过眼云烟，就好像从来没有来过这个地方，在这里祷告过、事奉过、生活过似的。

有一天，他悲伤的看着落日渐渐西沈，港湾里的船影逐渐模糊，他感到这就像他的人生。在夜色中，拖着有病的身体，他心灰意冷的坐在书房，书桌上的圣经正好翻开在路加福音24章。赖特牧师拿起圣经，随手指着一节经文，就读了起来，他低声的读着：“时候晚了，日头已经平西了，请你同我们住下来。耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。”这是路加福音24章29节。

赖特牧师默想这节经文的时候，想到对他一生来说，时候确实已经晚了，似乎没有什么希望了。当事工、健康，甚至连生命都将要结束时，到底还有什么会留下来呢？但“耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。”这句话却深深感动他，他突然明白，当所有的都消逝之后，剩下的不只是一无所有的他，还有耶稣。主耶稣愿意与他同住。

他明白了，主耶稣所爱、所接纳的就是他这个人，而不是他为主所做的。他已经尽他所能，献上所有，他的心不应当灰心疲倦。想到这儿，他立刻拿出一张纸来，写下心中的感动。只用了几分钟，他就写下了“与我同住”这首圣诗。这首诗歌，成为许多人的帮助。

弟兄姐妹，你知道主的心吗？一个基督徒在“心情”和“看透万事上”，若失去当有的光彩，就是“灵性”生病的警讯。

主耶稣很少在你期待他的时候出现。他常在你最料想不到的时候出现，并且是在最不合逻辑的情况下向你走来。就在夜里四更天，祂从海面上向你走来。

当你遭遇危险时，主借着祂的话给你保护。当你灰心疲倦时，主的话成为你及时的力量。当你忧伤时，主的话给你带来安慰。当你受试探时，主的话为你开路。你生活中没有任何一样需要，不能在圣经里找到亮光。

若离了主的话，你就会胡思乱想，结果，徒然给自己增加烦恼。圣经之所以是“圣经”，是因为它是由圣者赐下，由圣灵引导，没有一点谬误，能使你成圣。愿我们不作心中自是的愚昧人，而是作作通达神的话语，每天被主的训言启示引导的智慧人。

The author of the hymn, Henry Francis Lyte, was an Anglican minister. He was a curate in County Wexford from 1815 to 1818. According to a plaque erected in his memory in Taghmon Church, he preached frequently in Killurin Church, about nine miles from there. During that time the rector of Killurin Parish, the Reverend Abraham Swanne, was a lasting influence on Lyte's life and ministry. Later he was vicar of All Saints' Church in Brixham, Devon, England. For most of his life Lyte suffered from poor health, and he would regularly travel abroad for relief, as was customary at that time.

There is some controversy as to the exact dating of the text to "Abide with Me". An article in The Spectator, 3 Oct. 1925, says that Lyte composed the hymn in 1820 while visiting a dying friend. It was related that Lyte was staying with the Hore family in County Wexford and had visited an old friend, William Augustus Le Hunte, who was dying. As Lyte sat with the dying man, William kept repeating the phrase "abide with me…". After leaving William's bedside, Lyte wrote the hymn and gave a copy of it to Le Hunte's family.

The belief is that when Lyte felt his own end approaching twenty-seven years later at the age of 54, as he developed tuberculosis, he recalled the lines he had written so many years before in County Wexford. The Biblical link for the hymn is Luke 24:29 in which the disciples asked Jesus to abide with them "for it is toward evening and the day is spent". Using his friend's more personal phrasing "Abide with Me", Lyte composed the hymn. His daughter, Anna Maria Maxwell Hogg, recounts the story of how "Abide with Me" came out of that context:

The summer was passing away, and the month of September (that month in which he was once more to quit his native land) arrived, and each day seemed to have a special value as being one day nearer his departure. His family were surprised and almost alarmed at his announcing his intention of preaching once more to his people. His weakness and the possible danger attending the effort, were urged to prevent it, but in vain. "It was better", as he used to say often playfully, when in comparative health, "to wear out than to rust out". He felt that he should be enabled to fulfil his wish, and feared not for the result. His expectation was well founded. He did preach, and amid the breathless attention of his hearers, gave them a sermon on the Holy Communion ... In the evening of the same day he placed in the hands of a near and dear relative the little hymn, "Abide with Me", with an air of his own composing, adapted to the words.

Just weeks later, on 20 November 1847 in Nice, then in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Lyte died. The hymn was sung for the very first time at Lyte's funeral. Special thanksgiving services to mark Lyte's bicentenary were held in Taghmon and Killurin churches. While he wrote a tune for the hymn, the most usual tune for the hymn is "Eventide" by William Henry Monk.
