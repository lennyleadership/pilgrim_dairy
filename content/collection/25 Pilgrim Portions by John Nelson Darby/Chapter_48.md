Christ is all 基督是一切

CHRIST IS ALL

“Jesus only.”  
Mark 9:8  


The heart is satisfied; can ask no more;  
All thought of self is now for ever o’er:  
Christ, its unmingled object, fills the heart  
In blest adoring love - its endless part.

Christ is the key to the puzzle of this world.  


May God give us to be anything or nothing, so that the Lord Jesus may be everything.  


The magnet always turns towards the pole; the needle always trembles a little when the storm and tempest roar, but its direction changes not; the needle of the Christian heart always points towards Christ.  


The only thing which can be truly blessing to our brethren, so precious because they belong to Him, is that which we reproduce of Him.  


It is in Christ that all our thoughts are adjusted, set right, judged, and purified; for the infiniteness of God Himself staggers the littleness of the heart of man when Christ does not give him a sure support; without depriving him of anything of the fulness which is in God, but quite the contrary, it is in Him that we appreciate what He is.  


If He is the life, all which that life does has Him for its end and object. Everything relates to Him: we do not eat without Him (how can we when He is our very life?), we do not drink without Him; what we say, what we do, is said and done in the name of the Lord Jesus.  


The most eminent Christian is one of whom no one has ever heard speak, some poor labourer or servant, whose all is Christ, and who does all for HIS eye, and His alone.  


Jesus is the fountain of all blessedness, sent to poor, weak, wretched sinners, that they may have abundance of comfort, of peace and of enjoyment.  


We must find everything but Christ nothing.  


No trial can touch a person who has Christ for his all. He may have lost this or lost that; but if he has Christ he has that which he cannot lose.  


It is not the quantity we do that makes spirituality, but the measure of presenting Christ: that is the value of our service, in a world where there is nothing of God.  


It is not always in the correction of the failures which come before us that sources of unhappiness are healed; they disappear when souls are nourished upon the riches which are in Christ. We must think of this; we must, while ourselves feeding upon Christ—and He gives us to feed on Him without stint—cause others to breathe a new atmosphere, where Christ is.  


He has purchased a “peculiar people, to be zealous of good works.” He has brought you to Himself, to have your whole heart wrapped up in His interests, your thoughts, actions, everything for Him. … Are we living enough out of the world (not merely out of its pleasures but its cares) and enough with Christ for Him to have a large place in the daily thoughts of our hearts? … Have we the consciousness from the time we get up in the morning till we go to bed at night, that our hearts are with Christ, … a consciousness that He is in us, and we identified with Him?

“只见耶稣。”（可九８）

　　惟有基督是我一切，  
　　所有的“己”全了结；  
　　我心满足不再多求，  
　　爱戴敬拜永无休。

　　基督是打开宇宙之谜的钥匙。  

　　但愿神使我们成为满有祂的成分，或一无所有。好让基督作我们的万有。  

　　磁铁永远是朝向极方的，磁针在暴风雨时，可能发生轻微的震动，但它的方向总是不变。基督徒的心，也永远是向着基督的。  

　　我们对于弟兄，是何等宝贵！因为他们是属于主的。而惟一能叫我们的弟兄真正得蒙祝福的，就是从我们活出的那位基督。  

　　我们所有的思想，是在基督里得到整理，改正，审判和洁净。由于人心是那么渺小，所以人若没有基督那稳定的支持，神本身的无限，就使他的渺小全然站立不住。虽然这样，却一点没有减轻祂在神里面的丰满；反而我们因着在祂里面，才能认识祂的所是。祂既然是生命，那么生命所活出来的，必定是以祂为目标和目的……凡事都是与祂有关系的，我们不能离开祂而吃，也不能离开祂而喝（怎样能够呢？因祂是我们的生命），我们所说所做，都是奉主耶稣的名。  

　　那最超等的基督徒，可能是从来没有被人称说或听闻过的人，也许是一个穷苦工人或仆婢；他的一切就是基督，他所做的事，都是行在主面前，并全是祂的。  

　　主耶稣是万福之源，受差遣来到贫弱可怜的罪人中间，叫他们得着多而又多的安慰，平安和喜乐。  

　　我们必须认定万事都是空，惟有基督才不空。  

　　以基督为一切的人，没有一个试炼能够摸着他，他可能失掉这个或那个，但他因有基督，就是有了一个永不失落的至宝。  

　　属灵的标准，不是看我们所做的有多少，乃是看我们所彰显的基督有多少。在这与神相悖的世界中，这个才算是我们工作的真价值。  

　　那些使人不喜乐的根源，不一定是因着我们能够纠正许多的失败，就得到医治；当人在基督里吸取丰富的喂养时，这些根源才会消灭无遗。我们应当思想这事，一方面自己先要吃喝而享用基督（祂把自己作为食物，无限量的赐给我们），另一方面，我们还得让别人能呼吸到有基督同在那新鲜的空气。  

　　“祂赎我们，特作自己的子民，热心为善。”祂已经带你们归祂自己，要你们全心以祂和祂的事为念，连你们的思想行动，以及一切，都圣别的归于祂……我们的生活，是否已经脱净世界（不只脱离世界的娱乐，也脱离所有的挂虑）？是否充分与基督同在，让祂在我们里面及心思中，有丰满优越的地位呢？自早晨起来，以至晚间就寝，心里有没有都是与基督同在的感觉，就是祂在我们里头，与我们完全合一的感觉？
