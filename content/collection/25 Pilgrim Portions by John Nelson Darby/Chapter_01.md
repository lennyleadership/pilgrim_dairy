SIN  

“All have sinned, and come  
short of the glory of God.”  

ROMANS 3:23  


Father! Thy sovereign love has sought  
    Captives to sin, gone far from Thee;  
The work that Thine Own Son hath wrought,  
    Has brought us back — in peace and free!

A single sin is more horrible to God than a thousand sins — nay, than all the sins in the world — are to us.  


It is the action of an independent will which is the principle of sin.  


God can let nothing pass; He can forgive all and cleanse from all, but let nothing pass.  


Christ is love; the greater sinner I am, the more need I have of Him.  

 
If all the sins that ever were committed in the world were congregated in your persons and were your own act, this need not prevent your believing in Christ and coming unto God through Him.  

 
Look at the state man is really in as regards the trust he puts in man rather than God. If his neighbour should ask him to do anything, though his conscience may tell him God hates what his neighbour wants him to do, still, rather than disoblige his companion, he will sin against God.  


Sinning and religiousness go on together. … Where the power of godliness is not, nearness to godly things is only the more dangerous.  


If our hearts … feel not sin, Christ felt it when He drank the cup and bore sin for us. If the heart does not feel the gravity of sin, not to the same point as Jesus knew it, but at least in some degree — if, feeble as it may be, the feeling of sin is a stranger to us—we have not at all entered into the mind of Jesus.  


Adam sinned and left God, because he thought more of what Satan offered him; he thought the devil a better friend to him than God: but he has since found out to his cost that the devil was a liar; that he never had the power of giving him what he promised, and that by catching at the devil's bait; he has received his hook, and that “the wages of sin is death.”  

 
On the cross hung the one spotless, blessed Man, yet forsaken of God. What a fact before the world! No wonder the sun was darkened — the central and splendid witness to God’s glory in nature, when the Faithful and True Witness cried to His God and was not heard. Forsaken of God! What does this mean? What part have I in the cross? One single part — my sins. … It baffles thought, that most solemn lonely hour which stands aloof from all before or after.  

 
Christ … died rather than allow sin to subsist before God.  


Directly grace acts in the heart, it gives the consciousness of sin; but, at the same time, the love of Christ reaches the conscience, deepening the consciousness of sin; but if this is deep, it is because the consciousness of the love of Christ is also deep.

“世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”《罗三: 23》

诗：父啊！你的大爱寻找那远离你的罪囚；
你儿子工作使我们回家──享平安自由！

  在神看来，有一个罪甚至比我们看一千个罪、世界上所有的罪，都更可恶。  
    
  这一个罪，就是人凭着自己独立意志而有的行动，而这个独立意志，就是犯罪的原则。  

　神虽然能赦免并洗净一切的罪，但祂从不马虎地让一件事随便过去。  
　  
　基督就是爱；我越是一个大罪人，就越需要祂。  
　  
　即使全世界上的人所犯过的罪，都集中在你一人身上，也不能拦阻你信靠基督，而藉着祂来到神的面前。  

　关于人如何宁愿倚靠人，而不倚靠神的情形，请看一看人的光景，便可知道。比如说人被邻舍请求，去做一件事，虽然良心明明警告他说，这件事乃是神所憎恶的，但他因为怕得罪朋友，就大胆地去做却不怕得罪神。  

　犯罪与“敬虔”是连在一起的；若里面没有敬虔的实际，那么越多摸神的事物，其危险性就越大。  

　虽然我们的心缺乏对罪的感觉，但当基督喝这苦杯而为我们担罪时，心里却是满有对罪的感觉！如果我们的心，不觉得罪的重压（当然不如主耶稣感觉那样厉害），或者连最起码最微弱的感觉也没有，也就是说，对罪毫无认识，那么我们就是从来都没有摸着主耶稣的心意。  

　亚当犯罪就离开了神，他以为撒但能给他更美之物。又认为撒但与神相比，或许是更好的朋友；但他后来吃过苦头，就发现撒但是说谎者，并且发现实际上撒但是毫无能力把所应许的东西赐给他的。亚当由于吃了撒但的饵，连毒钩也吞了下去，结局便是死，因为“罪的工价就是死。”  

　十字架上那位是圣洁无疵之赐万福的人，竟成为被神所弃的，这是摆在世人面前一件何等大的事！难怪当那位神真实忠信的见证者，向父神呼求而遭离弃的时候，日头就变黑，天地都变暗了（日光本是象征神的荣耀在自然界的中心，也表彰祂荣耀的见证）。祂竟然被神离弃！这是什么意思呢？这十字架于我个人有何关系呢？有一个关系到我的罪。这是空前绝后，又是最庄严肃穆的一个时刻，实非我们头脑所能想像的！  

　基督，祂宁舍身流血，也绝不愿容让一点罪在神面前有蔓延为害之余地。  
　　
　恩典一旦开始在人心中动工，马上就产生罪的感觉；同时基督的大爱就充沛着人的良心，以加深人知罪的感觉。如果说这个感觉很深，这是因为对基督大爱的感觉也很深。
