腓立比书
<!--more--> 

2:1 所以在基督里若有甚么劝勉、爱心有甚么安慰、圣灵有甚么交通、心中有甚么慈悲怜悯、  
2:2 你们就要意念相同、爱心相同、有一样的心思、有一样的意念、使我的喜乐可以满足。  
2:3 凡事不可结党、不可贪图虚浮的荣耀。只要存心谦卑、各人看别人比自己强。  
2:4 各人不要单顾自己的事、也要顾别人的事。  
2:5 你们当以基督耶稣的心为心。  

2:6 他本有　神的形像、不以自己与　神同等为强夺的。  
2:7 反倒虚己、取了奴仆的形像、成为人的样式。  
2:8 既有人的样子、就自己卑微、存心顺服、以至于死、且死在十字架上。  
2:9 所以　神将他升为至高、又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名、  
2:10 叫一切在天上的、地上的、和地底下的、因耶稣的名、无不屈膝、

2:11 无不口称耶稣基督为主、使荣耀归与父　神。  
2:12 这样看来、我亲爱的弟兄、你们既是常顺服的、不但我在你们那里、就是我如今不在你们那里、更是顺服的、就当<mark>恐惧战兢</mark>、作成你们得救的工夫 [^1]。    
2:13 因为你们立志行事、都是　神在你们心里运行、为要成就他的美意。  
2:14 凡所行的、都不要发怨言、起争论、   
2:15 使你们无可指摘、诚实无伪、在这弯曲悖谬的世代、作　神无瑕疵的儿女。你们显在这世代中、好像明光照耀、  

2:16 将生命的道表明出来、叫我在基督的日子、好夸我没有空跑、也没有徒劳。  
2:17 我以你们的信心为供献的祭物。我若被浇奠在其上、也是喜乐。并且与你们众人一同喜乐。  
2:18 你们也要照样喜乐、并且与我一同喜乐。  
2:19 我靠主耶稣指望快打发提摩太去见你们、叫我知道你们的事、心里就得着安慰。  
2:20 因为我没有别人与我同心、实在挂念你们的事。  

2:21 别人都求自己的事、并不求耶稣基督的事。  
2:22 但你们知道提摩太的明证、他兴旺福音与我同劳、待我像儿子待父亲一样。  
2:23 所以我一看出我的事要怎样了结、就盼望立刻打发他去。  
2:24 但我靠着主自信我也必快去。  
2:25 然而我想必须打发以巴弗提到你们那里去。他是我的兄弟、与我一同作工、一同当兵、是你们所差遣的、也是供给我需用的。  

2:26 他很想念你们众人、并且极其难过、因为你们听见他病了。  
2:27 他实在是病了、几乎要死。然而　神怜恤他、不但怜恤他、也怜恤我、免得我忧上加忧。  
2:28 所以我越发急速打发他去、叫你们再见他、就可以喜乐、我也可以少些忧愁。  
2:29 故此你们要在主里欢欢乐乐的接待他。而且要尊重这样的人。  
2:30 因他为作基督的工夫、几乎至死、不顾性命、要补足你们供给我的不及之处。  



[^1]: [腓二12]   
[应当战兢][神的怒气] [诗篇九十7 和合本] 我们因你的怒气而消灭，因你的忿怒而惊惶。  
[‪Psalm s‬90:7 NKJV] For we have been consumed by Your anger, And by Your wrath we are terrified.
<br />  
[战兢] [林前二3 和合本] 我在你们那里、又软弱、又惧怕、又甚<mark>战兢</mark>。  
‪[1 Corinthians‬2:3 NKJV] I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
<br />  
[战兢] [传道书五1 和合本] 所罗门说，“你到神的殿，要<mark>谨慎脚步</mark>；因为近前听，胜过愚昧人献祭，他们本不知道所作的是恶。”   
[‪Ecclesiastes‬5:1 NKJV] Walk prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.  
<br />  
[应当战兢] “徒具形式，而没有敬虔的实意，不是出于心灵和诚实的敬拜”是枉然的。犹大书11节，主的兄弟犹大说，“他们有祸了！因为走了该隐的道路。”“他们”指的是徒有敬虔外貌，而违背敬虔实意的假教师。
<br />  
[神的怒气][敬畏]  (诗篇90:11 和合本)谁晓得你怒气的权势？谁按着你该受的敬畏晓得你的忿怒呢？  
(Psalms90:11 NKJV) Who knows the power of Your anger? For as the fear of You, so is Your wrath.  
(Psa 90:11 ESV) Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you?  
<br />  
[竭力] [提后二4 和合本] 凡在军中当兵的、不将世务缠身、好叫那招他当兵的人喜悦。  
‪[2 Timothy‬2:4 NKJV]  No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier.

[**William MacDonald's Commentary**]  
Having set forth the example of Christ in such brilliant luster, the apostle is now ready to press home the exhortation based on it.  
The Philippians had always obeyed Paul when he was present with them. Now much more in his absence, they should work out their own salvation with fear and trembling.  
Again we come to a passage of Scripture concerning which there has been much confusion. At the outset, we should be very clear that Paul is not teaching that salvation can be earned by works. Throughout his writings, he repeatedly emphasizes that salvation is not by works but by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. What then does the verse mean?  
I. It may mean that we are to work out the salvation which God has placed within us. God has given us eternal life as a free gift. We are to live it out by lives of practical holiness.  
II. Salvation here may mean the solution of their problem at Philippian. They had been plagued with squabbles and strife. The apostle has given them the remedy. Now they are to apply the remedy by having the mind of Christ. Thus they would work out their own salvation, or the solution of their difficulty.  
The salvation spoken of here is not that of the soul, but deliverance from the snares which would hinder the Christian from doing the will of God. In a similar vein, Vine describes it as the present entire experience of deliverance from evil.  
Salvation has many different meanings in the NT. We have already noticed that in Php 1:19 it means deliverance from prison. In Php 1:28 it refers to the eventual salvation of our bodies from the very presence of sin. The meaning in any particular case must be determined in part, at least, by the context. We believe that in this passage salvation means the solution of the problem that was vexing the Philippians, that is, their contentions.  
<br />  
[**Matthew Henry's Commentary**] [魂的救恩]  
I. He exhorts them to diligence and seriousness in the Christian course: **Work out your own salvation**. It is <mark>the salvation of our souls (1Pe 1:9)</mark> [^2], and our <mark>eternal salvation (Heb 5:9)</mark> [^3], and contains deliverance from all the evils sin had brought upon us and exposed us to, and the possession of all good and whatsoever is necessary to our complete and final happiness. Observe, It concerns us above all things to secure the welfare of our souls: whatever becomes of other things, let us take care of our best interests. It is our own salvation, the salvation of our own souls. It is not for us to judge other people; we have enough to do to look to ourselves; and, though we must promote <mark>the common salvation (Jud 1:3)</mark> as much as we can, yet we must upon no account neglect our own. We are required to work out our salvation, *<font color ="blue">katergazesthe</font>*. The word signifies working thoroughly at a thing, and taking true pains. Observe, We must be diligent in the use of all the means which conduce to our salvation. We must not only work at our salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must work out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering therein to the end. Salvation is the great thing we should mind, and set our hearts upon; and we cannot attain salvation without the utmost care and diligence. He adds, With fear and trembling, that is, with great care and circumspection: “Trembling for fear lest you miscarry and come short. Be careful to do every thing in religion in the best manner, and fear lest under all your advantages you should so much as seem to come short,” Heb 4:1 [^4]. Fear is a great guard and preservative from evil.  
II. He urges this from the consideration of their readiness always to obey the gospel: “As you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, Php 2:12. You have been always willing to comply with every discovery of the will of God; and that in my absence as well as presence. You make it to appear that regard to Christ, and care of your souls, sway more with you than any mode of showing respect whatsoever.” They were not merely awed by the apostle's presence, but did it even much more in his absence. “And because it is God who worketh in you, do you work out your salvation. Work, for he worketh.” It should encourage us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain. God is ready to concur with his grace, and assist our faithful endeavours. Observe, Though we must use our utmost endeavours in working out our salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a dependence upon the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way suitable to our natures, and in concurrence with our endeavours; and the operations of God's grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are intended to quicken and engage our endeavours. “And work out our salvation with fear and trembling, for he worketh in you.” All our working depends upon his working in us. “Do not trifle with God by neglects and delays, lest you provoke him to withdraw his help, and all your endeavours prove in vain. Work with fear, for he works of his good pleasure.” - To will and to do: he gives the whole ability. It is the grace of God which inclines the will to that which is good: and then enables us to perform it, and to act according to our principles. Thou hast wrought all our works in us, Isa 26:12. Of his good pleasure. As there is no strength in us, so there is no merit in us. As we cannot act without God's grace, so we cannot claim it, nor pretend to deserve it. God's good will to us is the cause of his good work in us; and he is under no engagements to his creatures, but those of his gracious promise.  
[^2]: 彼前一9 并且得着你们信心的果效、就是灵魂的救恩。  
(1Pe 1:9 KJV)  Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.  
[^3]: 希五9 他既得以完全、就为凡顺从他的人、成了永远得救的根源。  
(Heb 5:9 KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;  
[^4]: 希四1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许、就当畏惧、免得我们中间、〔我们原文作你们〕或有人似乎是赶不上了。    
(Heb 4:1 KJV)  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.  
<br />  
[**John MacArthur's Commentary**]  
**work out your own salvation** The Gr. verb rendered "work out" means "to continually work to bring something to fulfillment or completion."  It can't refer to salvation by works (cf. Rom. 3:21-24; Eph. 2:8-9), but it does refer to the believer's responsibility for active pursuit of obedience in the process of sanctification (see notes on 3:13,14; Rom 6:19; cf. 1Cor. 9:24-27; 15:58; 2Cor. 7:1; Gal. 6:7-9; Eph 4:1; Col. 3:1-17; Heb. 6:10, 11; 12:1,2; 2Pet. 1:5-11)  
**fear and trembling**. The attitude with which Christians are to pursue their sanctification.  It involves a healthy fear of offending God and a rightous awe and respect for Him (cf. Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Is. 66:1,2).
