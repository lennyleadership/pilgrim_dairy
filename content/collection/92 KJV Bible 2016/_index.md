The King James Version 2016 seeks to continue the work of updating the Bible into the language of today. The KJV 2016 is still based upon the same Greek Textus Receptus manuscript as the original King James Version. This new Bible does not seek to replace the original King James Version, it was made to replace modern translations based on corrupt manuscripts.
