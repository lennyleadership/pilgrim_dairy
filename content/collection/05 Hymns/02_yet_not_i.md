Verse 1  
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer  
There is no more for heaven now to give  
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom  
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace  
  
Refrain 1  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
For my life is wholly bound to his  
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
  
Verse2  
The night is dark but I am not forsaken  
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay  
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing  
For in my need, His power is displayed  
  
Refrain 2  
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me  
Through the deepest valley He will lead  
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
  
Verse 3  
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven  
The future sure, the price it has been paid  
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon  
And He was raised to overthrow the grave  
  
Refrain 3  
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated  
Jesus now and ever is my plea  
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
  
Verse 4  
With every breath I long to follow Jesus  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day I know He will renew me  
Until I stand with joy before the throne  
  
Refrain 4  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him  
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!  
  
Refrain 4  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him  
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:

Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet Not I But Through Christ In Me  
   
1  
何等禮物耶穌是我救贖主  
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer  
何等豐富，神已無別恩賜  
There is no more for heaven now to give  
祂是我的喜樂、公義和自由  
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom  
不變的愛、無限深廣平安  
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace  
我心堅信，唯耶穌是我盼望  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
我生命與祂緊緊相連  
For my life is wholly bound to His  
何稀奇，這恩典  
Oh How strange and divine!  
都歸我！  
I can sing: All is mine!  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, But through Christ in me  
   
2  
黑夜雖深，但我不會被丟棄  
The night is dark but I am not forsaken  
因我救主，永遠在我身邊  
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay  
我雖軟弱，仍歡歡喜喜往前  
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing  
我的缺乏顯出祂的大能  
For in my need, His power is displayed  
我心堅信，我牧者必保護我  
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me  
祂領我，走過死蔭幽谷  
Through the deepest valley He will lead  
哦，黑暗要過去  
Oh the night has been won,  
我得勝！  
and I shall overcome!  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
   
3  
無有懼怕，我知我已被赦免  
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven  
前途光明， 罪債已經付清  
The future sure, the price it has been paid  
耶穌流血， 受苦痛為我救贖  
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon  
死裡復活，完全勝了墳墓  
And He was raised to overthrow the grave  
我心堅信，我罪已完全解決  
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated  
耶穌是我永遠的遮蔽  
Jesus now and ever is my plea  
哦，鎖鏈已脫落  
Oh the chains are released,  
我自由！  
I can sing: I am free  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
   
4  
一息尚存，我要跟隨主耶穌  
With every breath I long to follow Jesus  
祂已應許，領我走到天家  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
日復一日，我知祂在改變我  
And day by day I know He will renew me  
直至那日，歡喜到寶座前  
Until I stand with joy before the throne  
我心堅信，唯耶穌是我盼望  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
全榮耀一切都歸給祂  
All the glory evermore to Him  
當跑完所有路  
When the race is complete,  
我要唱  
still my lips shall repeat  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
我心堅信，唯耶穌是我盼望  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
全榮耀一切都歸給祂  
All the glory evermore to Him  
當跑完所有路  
When the race is complete,  
我要唱  
still my lips shall repeat  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
當跑完所有路  
When the race is complete,  
我要唱  
still my lips shall repeat  
不是我，乃是基督在裡面活  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me  
乃是基督在裡面活  
but through Christ in me  
乃是基督在裡面活  
but through Christ in me
