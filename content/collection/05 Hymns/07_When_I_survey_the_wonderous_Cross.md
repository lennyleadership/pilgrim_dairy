Prolific hymn writer Isaac Watts wrote the lyrics for “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross.” He is credited with writing over 750 hymns in his lifetime and is referred to as the “Father of English Hymnody.”

Watts was born in Southampton, England, in 1674 and was brought up in a Nonconformist home, which was the term used to describe a Protestant Christian who did not conform with the Church of England. After receiving his education from Dissenting Academy at Stoke Newington, he spent two years at home, where most of his hymns were written. “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross” was published in 1707 in a collection called Hymns and Spiritual Songs. The music that is most often used with this hymn was composed by Lowell Mason.

This hymn is particularly powerful because it includes many poetic devices. For example, oxymoron is found twice in the first stanza: “my richest gain I count but loss” and “pour contempt on all my pride.” The third stanza contains a paradox in a crown of thorns, and there are two rhetorical questions in the second half of this stanza: “Did e’er such love and sorrow met, or thorns compose so rich a crown?” The piece ends with a climax, “Demands my soul, my life, my all.”

The theology of this hymn functions powerfully in the context of a worship service. Adey continues: “About to receive the Sacrament, the poet meditates upon the love that turned that instrument of judicial torture and death into the channel of divine compassion.”
