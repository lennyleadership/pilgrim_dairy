1  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of glory died,  
My richest gain I count but loss,  
And pour contempt on all my pride.  

2  
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,  
Save in the death of Christ my God:  
All the vain things that charm me most,  
I sacrifice them to His blood.  

3  
See from His head, His hands, His feet,  
Sorrow and love flow mingling down:  
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  

4  
Were the whole realm of nature mine,  
That were an offering far too small,  
Love so amazing, so divine,  
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

This is a deeply solemn hymn.

# Understanding

### I. From the first verse we learn that it was on the cross that the "Prince of glory died."

"When I survey the wondrous cross,

On which the Prince of glory died,

My richest gain I count but loss,

And pour contempt on all my pride."

*1*. We need to "Survey" the Cross! "Survey" is defined as "to examine with reference to value; to view with a scrutinizing eye; inspect." The majority of people never survey the cross. It holds no value to them and hence, it is not the "wondrous cross"! Before you can become a servant of the Lord, you must "survey" the cross. You must see and understand and appreciate its value to your life. 

Without the cross there would be no reconciliation (Eph 2:16; Col 1:20). Therefore, we are to "glory" in the cross (Gal 6:14). The cross is the last thing most would want to glory in. After all, it was "to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness" (1 Cor 1:23). In reality though, the cross exposes what a desperate state we really are in. It exposes how utterly bankrupt we must be to make such suffering necessary.

*2*. On Which the "Prince of Glory Died. " Christ is the Prince of glory. He is a Prince in every way. He is the "Prince and Savior" (Acts 5:31). He is "the Prince of the kings of the earth" (Rev 1:5).

"Prince" in the above passages means: "author, prince or leader, and ruler." Hence, Christ is our Leader who brought us peace (Isa 9:6). The Jews killed the author of Life (Acts 3:15). He is Prince (author) and Savior - author of salvation (Heb 5:8-9). He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev 1:5). The poet catches this wonderful truth in the poem entitled:  

"The Cross"

1  
None ever came as far as He,

None ever bore such agony,

None ever gave as liberally,

As Christ who died for me!

2  
No love so great has e'er been known,

No grace so vast was ever shown,

No blood for sin could e'er atone,

But Christ's who died for me!

*3*. My richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. The cross reveals the folly of human pride. It teaches us to say: "I never knew myself a sinner, nor recognized Christ as my Savior,

"Until upon the cross I saw

My God who died to meet the law

That I had broken, then I say

My sin, and then my Savior."

We will never be able to see on that old rugged cross "the wonderful glories of God's great love" until we first see "our own unworthiness" and "pour contempt on all our pride." Listen to the apostle Paul:

<p class = "quote"><i>But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me, I have come to consider as (one combined) loss for Christ's sake. Yes, furthermore I count everything as loss compared to possession of the priceless privilege - the overwhelming preciousness, the surpassing worth and supreme advantage - of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, or perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more clearly and fully. For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish (refuse, dregs) in order that I may win (gain) Christ, the Anointed One (Phil 3:7-8, The Amplified Bible)</i></p>.

These former things that could have been counted as gains for Paul consisted of his honors in the Jewish religion. All of these things he counted loss - instead of service to be recorded and worthy of honors, they were rather sins and crimes condemned, and sorrowed for through life. Can we learn this great lesson. All gains out of Christ are losses for Christ! Nothing compares to a life lived in Christ Jesus. For Christ's sake Paul did lose everything . . . that is the total of his old life's values. His own family probably regarded him as a disgrace to Judaism. His fellow Pharisees considered him a traitor to the cause. The Jews in general thought of him as a renegade. Oh, yes, he paid the price, but it was well worth it. He lost the Jewish world (the old life with its values) in order to gain Christ Jesus, Lord of all. So did He - and so must we!


### II. Verse two teaches us that we should boast or glory only in Christ's death.

"Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,

Save in the death of Christ my Lord;

All the vain things that charm me most,

I sacrifice them to His blood."

People boast in many things. More often than not it is in the wrong things and to our own shame.

1. The Jews boasted in the Law and in their relationship to God (Rom 2:17,23). They were proud of their relation to the true God, but they were woefully lacking in their adherence to his will.

I hope their condition doesn't describe many of us today! We say that we have the truth as distinguished from human creeds and doctrines of men. We boast of being in the one body as distinguished from human denominations. And yet, do we often fail to display in our lives the spirit and conduct that should be forthcoming from such a relationship. We must understand that it is not enough to profess respect for God's word. We must keep it. If we violate God's word we dishonor God. God is honored when we live in keeping with our profession.

2. Some boast of their great wealth. The Psalmist speaks of "those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches" (Psa 49:6).

3. Some boast in their own works (Eph 2:8-9). We are not saved by works of our own merit, that we may boast or glory in what we have done. We are saved by works in the sense of doing the works God has appointed. Even here, the merit is not in the work, but it proves our faith in doing what God commands of us. In this sense we are saved by faith and works. No works, no faith! (See Jas 2:17-81.)

4. We should boast or glory in the Lord and his sacrifice (Rom 5:6-10). I like the way the New International Version translates those verses. The apostle Paul said: "Therefore as it is written, let him who boasts, boast in the Lord" (1 Cor 1:31).

I must be willing to sacrifice all for the Lord. It is really sacrifice when we are willing to give up the things which "charm us most." What are you willing to give in exchange for your soul (Mat 16:26)? This is a very poignant question when we realize that Christ sacrificed so much for us. This is beautifully captured in the poem entitled:

**He Became Sin for Us**

"O the mystery of His Mercy!

Unguessed depths of matchless grace,

Christ became that which He hated,

While God turned away His face.



Turned in wrath from His Beloved,

Hanging there upon the tree,

Strangely changed, and strangely bearing

All the sins of you and me.



Angels dared not look upon him,

But averted striken eyes,

Seeing, not the Lord of glory,

But a bleeding sacrifice.



Through the circling, endless ages,

Such a sight had never been;

He, the spotless Lamb of heaven,

Christ the Lord, becoming sin

<br>
How we ought to thank the Lord every day we live for taking the punishment for our sins that we might not have to take it. What a blessed sin offering.


### III. From verse three we learn of our Lord's suffering and love.

"See, from his head, His hands, His feet,  

Sorrow and love flow mingled down;

Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,

Or thorns compose so rich a crown."


<br>
And, my O my, how our blessed Lord did suffer! Matthew records the following:

> From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things (Mat 16:21).

Have you ever really considered what was really included in the "many things"? (Read Psa 22:8, 14-22; Isa 53.) All of this is horribly unfolded as we read the gospels. He was forsaken of the Father. He was scorned, despised and rejected. He was mocked and taunted and they hurled insults at him. They would shake their heads at him, spit in his face, slap him, hit him with their fists, and flog him. Finally they killed him in the most excruciating way known to man!

Our Lord was truly "familiar with sufferings" and esteemed not. The most precious One to ever walk this earth was pierced, crushed, afflicted and led as a "lamb to slaughter." He was truly "the man of sorrows."

But praise be to God, when the blood flowed from those royal arteries, it was sorrow and love mingled and they met as they ran down and dripped to the ground below. Please notice why Jesus suffered. It was because he loved us so much! Because of his great love he "died for our transgressions," "took our infirmities," "carried our sorrows," "was crushed for our iniqiuties," and "his wounds brought us peace and healing." He bore our sins in his body on the tree, he was sacrificed for our transgressions. This thought is captured well in the beautiful song:   

"Hallelujah! What a Savior"

"Man of sorrows, what a name, For the Son of God who came.

Ruined sinners to reclaim! Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood,

Sealed my pardon with His blood! Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Guilty, vile and helpless we, Spotless Lamb of God was He,

Full atonement! Can it be? Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Lifted up was He to die, It is finished was His cry,

Now in heaven exalted high, Hallelujah! What a Savior!



When He comes our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring,

Then anew this song we'll sing, Hallelujah! What a Savior!

They put on his head a rough, sharp crown of thorns the pain racked his head and the rivelets of blood tricked down his face - but thanks be to God that He now wears a glorious crown as King of kings and reigns over his kingdom at the Father's right hand (see Phil 2:5, 11, New International Version).

'Twas for You

Be still, and know that I am God.

Where you now tred, I too have trod --

I know your griefs -- I have a part,

I know the anguish of your heart.

Did I not walk the toilsome road,

A wanderer, without abode?

Did I not stand in Pilate's hall,

Though innocent, hear judgment fall?

Did I not hang on yonders tree

At Golgotha, to die for thee?

Was I not spat upon, slapped my face,

Before Pilate did the mob not make their case?

Did they not scorn, mock, reject, with great ado,

Oppress, afflict, and crush, all for you?

Ah, yes, my friend, I've journed far,

To break the might of death's cold bar

'Twas all for you I paid the price,

For you I made such sacrifice,

But 'twas for you I suffered and bled,

With a crown of thorns upon my head,

Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief,

In my suffering, love and sorrow did twain meet!



### IV. The last verse teaches that Christ's sacrifice demands my all.

"Were the whole realm of nature mine,

That were a present far too small;

Love so amazing, so divine,

Demands my soul, my life, my all."

Peter said, "Behold, we have left (forsaken) all and followed thee" (Mat 19:27). The Lord said, "So, likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple" (Lk 14:33). Paul said he had suffered the loss of all things for Christ (Phil 3:7-8). God demands our all! Are you willing to give it? This begins with the giving of myself to the Lord (2 Cor 8:5).

It is evident that many do not appreciate God's great love for they do not reciprocate with their lives. Rather than give all, most give none or very little! Many are glad that Christ gave his all, but they want to give very little! They do not want to even give of their time to come worship. My, my, but how they appreciate his love, so amazing, so divine. How ungrateful can we be? Remember, love gives! "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son" (Jn 3:16). <mark class = "lemon">Do you love the Lord</mark>? Are you a Christian? Will you give yourself in obedience to his will?

# Analysis
This hymn is particularly powerful because it includes many poetic devices. For example, oxymoron is found twice in the first stanza: “my richest gain I count but loss” and “pour contempt on all my pride.” The third stanza contains a paradox in a crown of thorns, and there are two rhetorical questions in the second half of this stanza: “Did e’er such love and sorrow met, or thorns compose so rich a crown?” The piece ends with a climax, “Demands my soul, my life, my all.”

# Background
Prolific hymn writer Isaac Watts wrote "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross" in preparation for a communion service in 1707. Originally, the hymn was named "Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of Christ," following the practice of the day to summarize a hymn's theme in the title. He based this hymn on the Scriptural reference of Galatians 6:14. “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” 

Watts wrote five stanzas for the original version of "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross." However, he put his fourth stanza in brackets, indicating it was the most likely one to be left out, if need be:

"His dying crimson, like a robe,  
Spreads o'er His body on the tree:  
Then am I dead to all the globe,  
And all the globe is dead to me."  

Other alterations have been made to this hymn through the years. For example, line 2 originally read "Young Prince of Glory," but in the second edition of the hymnal, Watts changed it to "When God, the Mighty Maker, died." It has also been "When Christ, the Lord of Glory, died," "When Christ, the Great Redeemer, died," and "When Christ, the Great Creator, died." In the nineteenth century there were numerous collections with extensive alterations to the hymn.  

It was first published in 1707 in Watt's collection Hymns and Spiritual Songs.  The music that is most often used with this hymn was composed by Lowell Mason. Isaac Watts is credited with writing over 750 hymns in his lifetime and is referred to as the “Father of English Hymnody.”

# Life
Isaac Watts was born in Southampton, England, in 1674 and was brought up in a Nonconformist home, which was the term used to describe a Protestant Christian who did not conform with the Church of England. After receiving his education from Dissenting Academy at Stoke Newington, he spent two years at home, where most of his hymns were written.

He was forced to resign a pastorate because of poor health.

我每静念那十字架 

【第1节】  

我每静念那十字架，  
并主如何在上受熬，  
我就不禁浑忘身家，  
鄙视从前所有倨傲。  

【第2节】  

愿主禁我别有所夸，  
除了基督的十字架；  
前所珍爱虚空荣华，  
今为祂血情愿丢下。  
 
【第3节】  

看从祂头！祂脚！祂手！  
忧情、慈爱和血而流！  
那有爱忧如此相遘?  
荆棘编成如此冕旒?  

【第4节】  

看祂全身满披水血，  
如同穿上朱红衣饰！  
因此，我与世界断绝，  
世界向我也象已死。  

【第5节】  

假若宇宙都归我手，  
尽以奉主仍觉可羞；  
爱既如此奇妙、深厚，  
当得我心、我命-所有。

<div id="chinese2" class="tabcontent">

我每靜念那十字架，並主如何在上受熬，  

我就不禁渾忘身家，鄙視從前所有倨傲。  

　　在法國有一位出身貴族的太太，年輕時喪偶。當遭到這樣的變故後，她抑制了傷慟，含辛聒苦的將三個孩子撫養長大成人，也把一切的希望都寄託在他們身上，她接受友人的建議把三個孩子帶往美洲。到達美洲後，有一天，三人迷路而進入荒山，被印地安人毒箭所射殺。消息傳到寡母這裡，她謝絕了人們的安慰，關上門，獨自靜坐房中，低聲唱道：「我每靜念那十字架，並主如何在上受熬，我就不禁渾忘身家…。」於是，她的心溶化了，基督的愛使她忘了如此難忍的悲傷。這一首感人肺腑的詩歌，就是以撒華滋（Isaac Watts）不朽的傑作「我每靜念那十字架」。  

　　以撒華滋於一六七四年生於英國蘇登普登郡（Southampton），自幼即充滿脫滿傳統束縛的自由思想，他是神賜給教會的「天才」。當他年歲稍長，看到當時更正教各種聚會的光景已日益消沉、低落，漸漸落在儀文和形式中。有一次，他返鄉參加聚會，曾率直的對父親批評當時教會所唱的詩篇，於返家後即根據啟示錄第五章的背景，寫成了甚獲會眾喜愛的「頌讚被殺羔羊」，這是他最初的作品。以後的四年中，共寫了一百一十首之多，「我每靜念那十字架」就是其中感人至深的一首。  

　　這一首詩歌據說緣於一個動人的故事。一位寡婦艱辛的撫養三子成人，並且把他們都獻給主用。長子奉差至非洲傳道，不多時即被土人所殺害。她聽到這消息，沒有發出任何怨尤，只是跪在神面前讚美，**以為其子配為主殉道**。旋即打發次子承繼兄志，不久亦遭殺害。最後打發三子前往，竟也罹同樣遭遇。親友紛往探慰，友人問她：「你將三個兒子全獻與主，為福音擺上，現今他們都已殉道，**你懊悔不**？」她答道：「我很懊悔，**因我再無第四個兒子可以獻給主**。」後來她禱告說：「假若宇宙都歸我手，盡以奉主仍覺可羞。」事為以撒聽到，內心深受激勵，因此配上了深印在他心中的經節--「我斷不以別的誇口，只誇我們主耶穌基督的十字架，因這十字架就我而論，世界已經釘在十字架上；就世界而論，我已經釘在十字架上。」（加拉太書六章十四節），於是就寫成了這一首詩歌。  

　　「看從祂頭，祂腳，祂手，憂情、慈愛和血而流…看祂全身滿被水血，如同穿上朱紅衣飾…」哦，主曾流血，捨命亡躬，在十字架上忍受這樣苦難，真是憐憫何滿！慈愛何泛！恩典何其無邊！因著這首詩歌，英國名將愛德華羅伯特在一次福音聚會中，那剛硬的心也被感動，情不自禁地跪下痛泣。後來他作見證說：「我無法描述我當時唱第三節的感覺，『看從祂頭，祂腳，祂手，憂情、慈愛和血而流！』我立刻跪下大哭。我從來沒有這樣哭過，實在是基督的愛使我如此。」他的妻子為著他的得救已禱告了八年，那晚是禱告蒙應許的日子，愛德華將軍因著這首詩歌就蒙了拯救，一生謙卑地投靠在基督十架下。  

　　當教會復興之流流過英國威爾斯每一個角落的時候，幾乎每處聚會都可聽到這首詩的歌聲；凡是唱它或是聽到的人，莫不潸然淚下，如同目睹頭戴荊冕，滿被水血的基督。主的愛藉著聖靈的能力溶化了人們的心，許許多多的人因著這首歌而淚流滿面，認罪悔改，接受替他們受死的基督為救主。  

　　以撒華滋所作的詩歌前後共達六百首之多，在教會中使用後，給聚會帶來了新的生命，產生了極深遠的影響，後人即尊他為「英國聖詩之父」。愛丁堡大學且於一七二八年他榮譽博士學位，但是在以撒的心意中，只望能藉著詩歌來榮耀神，並不重此「身家」，「倨傲」。他深被基督十字架的摯愛所吸引，一生以弱病之身事主，忠心至死，未曾稍懈。一七四八年十一月廿五日歿於倫敦，葬在本恩園，與本仁約翰之墓毗鄰。  

　　他曾作一首詩歌「哎喲！救主真曾流血？」（詩歌第93首）與「我每靜念那十字架」有同樣的思想和感覺，都是說到主的受死，再引導我們當因這愛而獻上一生。主曾為我們在十字架上受熬，忍受一切苦難，對著這比死堅強，比水忍耐的大愛，我們怎能不心鎔而讚美：「主！你當得我心，我命，所有。」

以上这首感人最深、被教会使用最广的诗歌之一是英国诗人以撒·瓦茨(Isaac Watts, 1674-1748)所写的著名圣歌, 首次在1707年出版的赞美诗集《圣歌与灵歌》(Hymns and Spiritual Songs)中出现. 这位被历代教会推崇为“英国赞美诗之父”(the father of English hymnody)的瓦茨, 在1674年生于英国南安普顿(Southhampton)的一个虔诚爱主之家. 他的父亲是一个源于清教徒独立教会的执事. 瓦茨的母亲是欧洲大陆人, 也是清教徒的后裔, 为主缘故受逼迫而逃到英国.

过后英国国教会(即圣公会)极力逼迫清教徒, 瓦茨的父亲为了对主忠诚也遭受诸多迫害. 当瓦茨出世时, 父亲被囚在狱中. 母亲常抱着年小的瓦茨到狱中探望父亲. 瓦茨9岁时, 他的父亲又因着主的缘故无法在当地立足, 被逼离开家庭, 独自漂泊在外. 然而, 瓦茨的虔诚父母在他年幼时所种下的属灵影响既深又远.

以撒·瓦茨7岁时便信主得救, 归于主的名下. 圣灵把神的爱浇灌在这孩子的心田里, 并使这爱在他心中萌芽生长. 瓦茨从小天资聪颖, 故此在他年少时, 许多有名望的人愿意介绍他进入牛津大学深造, 以后可作牧师. 当时英国国教中的牧师职位获得一般人所羡慕, 但瓦茨为主缘故坚决拒绝, 只愿清心、单纯地跟随主.

神训练祂的器皿所用的方式, 永远是我们天然有限的思想所不能明白的. 以撒·瓦茨自小体弱多病, 到他成人的时候, 体格还是十分矮小, 而且气貌不扬. 神却赐给他讲道的恩赐, 他每次站在讲台上传扬神的信息时, 总是充满新鲜的启发, 而且充满能力, 令听者心灵震动. 可是神对他有更美好的计划. 他的一生中尽是坎坷和艰难, 并且终身未娶, 过着孤单的生活, 还一直被病魔所缠. 1713年, 因他旧病复发, 他的朋友(Sir Thomas Abney)接他到乡下一间别墅休养, 哪知一去就住了36年, 直到1748年离世之日. 在这36年的单身日子中, 他除了偶尔为主讲道之外, 其余时间都专一用在写诗的工作上, 一直到75岁, 才安然离世.

论到以撒·瓦茨被誉为“圣诗之父”的原因, 史伯诚(Newman Sze)在所著的《诗人与诗歌》(The Hymnists and Their Hymns)写道: “因为是从他起头, 开创了一个风气, 使多少神所使用的人, 藉着现代的语文, 将所得的启示、经历、灵感, 写成许多宝贵的诗歌, 使后世的教会收益无穷; 并且在当时神也确实藉着所赐给他写诗的恩赐, 将那一个时代的教会, 带进一个属灵的复兴.

“那个时代, 英国的教会经过了17、18两个世纪, 清教徒复兴之后, 已经逐渐趋于冷淡, 到了以撒·瓦茨的时候, 教会已经落到十分荒凉的地步, 神的儿女对属灵的事完全失去了兴趣, 很难发现有属灵的生活. 甚至到了一个地步, 在各处聚会中, 常会发现牧师在讲台上讲些无所谓的道, 而圣徒们则坐在下面彼此闲谈, 有人在聚会中随便吃喝, 有人就索性在聚会中休息睡觉. 教会的情形已经到了不能继续生存的地步.”

“正像神在历代所作的事一样, 当教会堕落到极其荒凉的时候, 神的手就进来干涉. 神必须找到一个器皿, 来挽回属灵荒凉的局面, 复兴祂的教会. 那时所使用的器皿, 就是以撒·瓦茨. 神使用他的方式, 是非常独特的; 神并不是藉着他所释放的信息或他的工作来复兴教会, 乃是藉着神所赐给他写诗的恩赐, 带给教会一个大复兴, 使笼罩英国教会所有的暮气, 一扫而空. 他的诗歌在那个时代的英国教会中, 所发生的影响、能力和价值, 只有到永世里我们才能清楚计算.”[105]

在以撒·瓦茨的诗歌中, 十字架是他所钟爱的主题之一. 史伯诚评述道: “他所写的诗歌非常多, 但因他是一个特别认识十字架救赎大爱的人, 主不仅将羔羊钉十字架的大爱启示在他心里, 也将这爱浇灌在他心中, 所以在他所写的这许多诗歌中, 最能摸着人心, 流露生命的诗歌, 都是关于主耶稣钉十字架的. 一直到今天, 诗人所写的诗歌中, 关于主钉十字架、救赎大爱一类的诗歌, 没有一个能赶上以撒·瓦茨的.”[106] 上述的“当我思量奇妙十架”便是最佳例子.

历代以来, 这首感人肺腑的诗歌不知感动和激励了多少圣徒. 以下略举几个见证:

在法国有一位公爵夫人, 早年守寡. 她费尽心思地把三个儿子养大成人, 个个品学兼优, 为众亲友所称赞. 她把一切希望都寄托在这三个儿子身上. 那时正值发现新大陆之时, 她听从了友人的建议, 让这三子往新大陆去淘金, 不料抵达美洲不久后, 三人在荒山中迷路, 死于红蕃毒箭之下. 这噩讯传至巴黎, 友人不敢让寡妇知道, 怕她无法承受这样一个打击. 然而, 她终于得知此事, 当即闭门谢客, 拒绝一切从人而来的安慰. 当她极度忧伤时, 就独自一人静坐房中, 唱这一首诗歌: “当我思量奇妙十架, 荣耀之主在上悬挂, 平生所珍顿看有损…”. 基督的爱充满了她, 使她的心完全转移并倾注在那位爱她、为她受苦的基督身上, 助她胜过了丧子的哀痛.

昔日英国一位名将罗伯特(Edward Robert)有位非常爱主的妻子, 而他本身是个顽固的不信者. 某次, 他因妻子坚邀, 勉强陪同共赴布道大会. 第二天晚上, 他自己又去听道. 当晚聚会上所唱的, 正是这首诗歌, 圣灵使用这首诗歌大大感动罗伯特. 罗伯特后来作见证说: “我就是从现在说到明天, 也说不出那种感觉. 我只记得当我唱到第三节: “试看主头、主足、主手, 慈爱、忧愁和血而流; 如此爱、忧, 自古焉有? …” 我立刻跪下大哭, 我从来没有这样哭过, 实在是基督的爱感动了我. 我站起之后, 就走到台前承认救主, 回到家里正想把这好消息告诉妻子, 哪知她正在家里为我祷告, 她为我的得救之事, 已祷告8年了.”

叨雷(另译“陶雷”, Reuben A. Torrey, 1856-1928)和雅查理(Charles Alexander)在英国的大复兴4年中, 曾领10万以上的人信主得救, 尤其是在伯明翰(Birmingham)的那一次, 据说30天内得救的人数竟高达8千. 在一次最高潮的聚会中, 叨雷用约翰福音3:16讲了三刻钟, 没有故事比喻, 也没有巧妙的话语, 然而圣灵就是那样感动了人的心. 结束时, 就请人站起来接受主. 接着一个, 两个, 三个, 五个, 许多人站起来了. 正当肃静等候时, 雅查理突然唱出了: “试看主头、主足、主手, 慈爱、忧愁和血而流; 如此爱、忧, 自古焉有? 荆棘反成荣耀冕旒!” 基督的爱, 藉着圣灵的能力进入了每一个人的心! 许多人泪流满面, 约有250多人陆续到前面来, 排列在座位中和讲台两侧, 刚好形成一“十”字形, 同声祷告接受耶稣作他们的救主.

英国的威尔士大复兴(Welsh Revival, 发生于1904至1905年间), 是英国教会历史上的一大复兴. 据说埃文斯·罗伯茨(另译“伊文罗伯斯”, Evan Roberts, 1878-1951)初到此地时, 在短时间内, 就有7万8千 人信主得救, 接着复兴的火烧遍了威尔士的每一个角落. 那时最常用的诗歌, 就是这一首“当我思量奇妙十架”. 几乎在每处聚会中都能听见. 埃文斯·罗伯茨常是习惯地从聚会的地方往外走, 许多人便跟在他后面, 一面走一面同声高唱: “试看主头、主足、主手”  一路上加入的人越来越多, 直走到一个足以容纳万人站立的旷地. 还未开始传扬福音信息, 多少人的心已被圣灵藉着这首诗歌溶化了. 史伯诚如此形容, 在威尔士大复兴时, 这首诗歌是“神所使用的一件最锋利的兵器”.[107]
 
神不仅藉着此诗“当我思量奇妙十架”教导我们有关十架的真理, 也藉着此诗作者的一生教导了我们许多宝贵的功课. 鲁斯登(E. Michael Rusten)指出, 以撒·瓦茨只有5英尺高, 头大鼻弯, 眼小又尖, 体质又弱, 实为外貌不扬的人. 他向所爱的女人求婚时, 对方因他外貌长相难看而立刻拒绝他. 以撒·瓦茨一生没有结婚.

人看外貌, 神却看内心(撒上16:7). 神知道他对基督有一颗单纯爱慕之心, 便赐给他写诗的恩赐. 在以撒·瓦茨18岁那年, 他向父亲表示教会所用的诗歌词句不佳. 身为老师的父亲就挑战他写出更好的诗歌, 结果在下一个主日, 他所写的第一首诗歌就在敬拜中派上用场. 在接下来的两年里, 年轻的瓦茨就写成了他首个赞美诗集中的大部分诗歌. 这首个赞美诗集于1707年出版, 名为《圣歌与灵歌》(Hymns and Spiritual Songs), 可说是第一本英文赞美诗集.  

鲁斯登写道: “照人看来, 瓦茨的生命中有许多的创伤, 他因外貌不扬而受尽嘲笑, 被自己心爱的女人拒绝, 一生体弱多病, 甚至他的生活需要依赖他的朋友所施舍. 尽管如此, 瓦茨活出一个丰盛多产的生命. 他在那一晚离世之前这样说: ‘我是个罪人; 基督是我的救主. 我可以放弃一切; 基督那已完成的救赎工作是我一切的盼望. 依靠基督, 与基督同在是好的无比啊.’ ”
