1  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of glory died,  
My richest gain I count but loss,  
And pour contempt on all my pride.  

2  
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,  
Save in the death of Christ my God:  
All the vain things that charm me most,  
I sacrifice them to His blood.  

3  
See from His head, His hands, His feet,  
Sorrow and love flow mingling down:  
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  

4  
Were the whole realm of nature mine,  
That were an offering far too small,  
Love so amazing, so divine,  
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

This is a deeply solemn hymn.

# Understanding

### I. From the first verse we learn that it was on the cross that the "Prince of glory died."

"When I survey the wondrous cross,

On which the Prince of glory died,

My richest gain I count but loss,

And pour contempt on all my pride."

*1*. We need to "Survey" the Cross! "Survey" is defined as "to examine with reference to value; to view with a scrutinizing eye; inspect." The majority of people never survey the cross. It holds no value to them and hence, it is not the "wondrous cross"! Before you can become a servant of the Lord, you must "survey" the cross. You must see and understand and appreciate its value to your life. 

Without the cross there would be no reconciliation (Eph 2:16; Col 1:20). Therefore, we are to "glory" in the cross (Gal 6:14). The cross is the last thing most would want to glory in. After all, it was "to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness" (1 Cor 1:23). In reality though, the cross exposes what a desperate state we really are in. It exposes how utterly bankrupt we must be to make such suffering necessary.

*2*. On Which the "Prince of Glory Died. " Christ is the Prince of glory. He is a Prince in every way. He is the "Prince and Savior" (Acts 5:31). He is "the Prince of the kings of the earth" (Rev 1:5).

"Prince" in the above passages means: "author, prince or leader, and ruler." Hence, Christ is our Leader who brought us peace (Isa 9:6). The Jews killed the author of Life (Acts 3:15). He is Prince (author) and Savior - author of salvation (Heb 5:8-9). He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev 1:5). The poet catches this wonderful truth in the poem entitled:  

"The Cross"

1  
None ever came as far as He,

None ever bore such agony,

None ever gave as liberally,

As Christ who died for me!

2  
No love so great has e'er been known,

No grace so vast was ever shown,

No blood for sin could e'er atone,

But Christ's who died for me!

*3*. My richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. The cross reveals the folly of human pride. It teaches us to say: "I never knew myself a sinner, nor recognized Christ as my Savior,

"Until upon the cross I saw

My God who died to meet the law

That I had broken, then I say

My sin, and then my Savior."

We will never be able to see on that old rugged cross "the wonderful glories of God's great love" until we first see "our own unworthiness" and "pour contempt on all our pride." Listen to the apostle Paul:

<p class = "quote"><i>But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me, I have come to consider as (one combined) loss for Christ's sake. Yes, furthermore I count everything as loss compared to possession of the priceless privilege - the overwhelming preciousness, the surpassing worth and supreme advantage - of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, or perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more clearly and fully. For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish (refuse, dregs) in order that I may win (gain) Christ, the Anointed One (Phil 3:7-8, The Amplified Bible)</i></p>.

These former things that could have been counted as gains for Paul consisted of his honors in the Jewish religion. All of these things he counted loss - instead of service to be recorded and worthy of honors, they were rather sins and crimes condemned, and sorrowed for through life. Can we learn this great lesson. All gains out of Christ are losses for Christ! Nothing compares to a life lived in Christ Jesus. For Christ's sake Paul did lose everything . . . that is the total of his old life's values. His own family probably regarded him as a disgrace to Judaism. His fellow Pharisees considered him a traitor to the cause. The Jews in general thought of him as a renegade. Oh, yes, he paid the price, but it was well worth it. He lost the Jewish world (the old life with its values) in order to gain Christ Jesus, Lord of all. So did He - and so must we!


### II. Verse two teaches us that we should boast or glory only in Christ's death.

"Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,

Save in the death of Christ my Lord;

All the vain things that charm me most,

I sacrifice them to His blood."

People boast in many things. More often than not it is in the wrong things and to our own shame.

1. The Jews boasted in the Law and in their relationship to God (Rom 2:17,23). They were proud of their relation to the true God, but they were woefully lacking in their adherence to his will.

I hope their condition doesn't describe many of us today! We say that we have the truth as distinguished from human creeds and doctrines of men. We boast of being in the one body as distinguished from human denominations. And yet, do we often fail to display in our lives the spirit and conduct that should be forthcoming from such a relationship. We must understand that it is not enough to profess respect for God's word. We must keep it. If we violate God's word we dishonor God. God is honored when we live in keeping with our profession.

2. Some boast of their great wealth. The Psalmist speaks of "those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches" (Psa 49:6).

3. Some boast in their own works (Eph 2:8-9). We are not saved by works of our own merit, that we may boast or glory in what we have done. We are saved by works in the sense of doing the works God has appointed. Even here, the merit is not in the work, but it proves our faith in doing what God commands of us. In this sense we are saved by faith and works. No works, no faith! (See Jas 2:17-81.)

4. We should boast or glory in the Lord and his sacrifice (Rom 5:6-10). I like the way the New International Version translates those verses. The apostle Paul said: "Therefore as it is written, let him who boasts, boast in the Lord" (1 Cor 1:31).

I must be willing to sacrifice all for the Lord. It is really sacrifice when we are willing to give up the things which "charm us most." What are you willing to give in exchange for your soul (Mat 16:26)? This is a very poignant question when we realize that Christ sacrificed so much for us. This is beautifully captured in the poem entitled:

**He Became Sin for Us**

"O the mystery of His Mercy!

Unguessed depths of matchless grace,

Christ became that which He hated,

While God turned away His face.



Turned in wrath from His Beloved,

Hanging there upon the tree,

Strangely changed, and strangely bearing

All the sins of you and me.



Angels dared not look upon him,

But averted striken eyes,

Seeing, not the Lord of glory,

But a bleeding sacrifice.



Through the circling, endless ages,

Such a sight had never been;

He, the spotless Lamb of heaven,

Christ the Lord, becoming sin

<br>
How we ought to thank the Lord every day we live for taking the punishment for our sins that we might not have to take it. What a blessed sin offering.


### III. From verse three we learn of our Lord's suffering and love.

"See, from his head, His hands, His feet,  

Sorrow and love flow mingled down;

Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,

Or thorns compose so rich a crown."


<br>
And, my O my, how our blessed Lord did suffer! Matthew records the following:

> From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things (Mat 16:21).

Have you ever really considered what was really included in the "many things"? (Read Psa 22:8, 14-22; Isa 53.) All of this is horribly unfolded as we read the gospels. He was forsaken of the Father. He was scorned, despised and rejected. He was mocked and taunted and they hurled insults at him. They would shake their heads at him, spit in his face, slap him, hit him with their fists, and flog him. Finally they killed him in the most excruciating way known to man!

Our Lord was truly "familiar with sufferings" and esteemed not. The most precious One to ever walk this earth was pierced, crushed, afflicted and led as a "lamb to slaughter." He was truly "the man of sorrows."

But praise be to God, when the blood flowed from those royal arteries, it was sorrow and love mingled and they met as they ran down and dripped to the ground below. Please notice why Jesus suffered. It was because he loved us so much! Because of his great love he "died for our transgressions," "took our infirmities," "carried our sorrows," "was crushed for our iniqiuties," and "his wounds brought us peace and healing." He bore our sins in his body on the tree, he was sacrificed for our transgressions. This thought is captured well in the beautiful song:   

"Hallelujah! What a Savior"

"Man of sorrows, what a name, For the Son of God who came.

Ruined sinners to reclaim! Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood,

Sealed my pardon with His blood! Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Guilty, vile and helpless we, Spotless Lamb of God was He,

Full atonement! Can it be? Hallelujah! What a Savior!



Lifted up was He to die, It is finished was His cry,

Now in heaven exalted high, Hallelujah! What a Savior!



When He comes our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring,

Then anew this song we'll sing, Hallelujah! What a Savior!

They put on his head a rough, sharp crown of thorns the pain racked his head and the rivelets of blood tricked down his face - but thanks be to God that He now wears a glorious crown as King of kings and reigns over his kingdom at the Father's right hand (see Phil 2:5, 11, New International Version).

'Twas for You

Be still, and know that I am God.

Where you now tred, I too have trod --

I know your griefs -- I have a part,

I know the anguish of your heart.

Did I not walk the toilsome road,

A wanderer, without abode?

Did I not stand in Pilate's hall,

Though innocent, hear judgment fall?

Did I not hang on yonders tree

At Golgotha, to die for thee?

Was I not spat upon, slapped my face,

Before Pilate did the mob not make their case?

Did they not scorn, mock, reject, with great ado,

Oppress, afflict, and crush, all for you?

Ah, yes, my friend, I've journed far,

To break the might of death's cold bar

'Twas all for you I paid the price,

For you I made such sacrifice,

But 'twas for you I suffered and bled,

With a crown of thorns upon my head,

Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief,

In my suffering, love and sorrow did twain meet!



### IV. The last verse teaches that Christ's sacrifice demands my all.

"Were the whole realm of nature mine,

That were a present far too small;

Love so amazing, so divine,

Demands my soul, my life, my all."

Peter said, "Behold, we have left (forsaken) all and followed thee" (Mat 19:27). The Lord said, "So, likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple" (Lk 14:33). Paul said he had suffered the loss of all things for Christ (Phil 3:7-8). God demands our all! Are you willing to give it? This begins with the giving of myself to the Lord (2 Cor 8:5).

It is evident that many do not appreciate God's great love for they do not reciprocate with their lives. Rather than give all, most give none or very little! Many are glad that Christ gave his all, but they want to give very little! They do not want to even give of their time to come worship. My, my, but how they appreciate his love, so amazing, so divine. How ungrateful can we be? Remember, love gives! "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son" (Jn 3:16). <mark class = "lemon">Do you love the Lord</mark>? Are you a Christian? Will you give yourself in obedience to his will?

# Analysis
This hymn is particularly powerful because it includes many poetic devices. For example, oxymoron is found twice in the first stanza: “my richest gain I count but loss” and “pour contempt on all my pride.” The third stanza contains a paradox in a crown of thorns, and there are two rhetorical questions in the second half of this stanza: “Did e’er such love and sorrow met, or thorns compose so rich a crown?” The piece ends with a climax, “Demands my soul, my life, my all.”

# Background
Prolific hymn writer Isaac Watts wrote "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross" in preparation for a communion service in 1707. Originally, the hymn was named "Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of Christ," following the practice of the day to summarize a hymn's theme in the title. He based this hymn on the Scriptural reference of Galatians 6:14. “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” 

Watts wrote five stanzas for the original version of "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross." However, he put his fourth stanza in brackets, indicating it was the most likely one to be left out, if need be:

"His dying crimson, like a robe,  
Spreads o'er His body on the tree:  
Then am I dead to all the globe,  
And all the globe is dead to me."  

Other alterations have been made to this hymn through the years. For example, line 2 originally read "Young Prince of Glory," but in the second edition of the hymnal, Watts changed it to "When God, the Mighty Maker, died." It has also been "When Christ, the Lord of Glory, died," "When Christ, the Great Redeemer, died," and "When Christ, the Great Creator, died." In the nineteenth century there were numerous collections with extensive alterations to the hymn.  

It was first published in 1707 in Watt's collection Hymns and Spiritual Songs.  The music that is most often used with this hymn was composed by Lowell Mason. Isaac Watts is credited with writing over 750 hymns in his lifetime and is referred to as the “Father of English Hymnody.”

# Life
Isaac Watts was born in Southampton, England, in 1674 and was brought up in a Nonconformist home, which was the term used to describe a Protestant Christian who did not conform with the Church of England. After receiving his education from Dissenting Academy at Stoke Newington, he spent two years at home, where most of his hymns were written.

He was forced to resign a pastorate because of poor health.

我每静念那十字架 

【第1节】  

我每静念那十字架，  
并主如何在上受熬，  
我就不禁浑忘身家，  
鄙视从前所有倨傲。  

【第2节】  

愿主禁我别有所夸，  
除了基督的十字架；  
前所珍爱虚空荣华，  
今为祂血情愿丢下。  
 
【第3节】  

看从祂头！祂脚！祂手！  
忧情、慈爱和血而流！  
那有爱忧如此相遘?  
荆棘编成如此冕旒?  

【第4节】  

看祂全身满披水血，  
如同穿上朱红衣饰！  
因此，我与世界断绝，  
世界向我也象已死。  

【第5节】  

假若宇宙都归我手，  
尽以奉主仍觉可羞；  
爱既如此奇妙、深厚，  
当得我心、我命-所有。

<div id="chinese2" class="tabcontent">

我每靜念那十字架，並主如何在上受熬，  

我就不禁渾忘身家，鄙視從前所有倨傲。  

　　在法國有一位出身貴族的太太，年輕時喪偶。當遭到這樣的變故後，她抑制了傷慟，含辛聒苦的將三個孩子撫養長大成人，也把一切的希望都寄託在他們身上，她接受友人的建議把三個孩子帶往美洲。到達美洲後，有一天，三人迷路而進入荒山，被印地安人毒箭所射殺。消息傳到寡母這裡，她謝絕了人們的安慰，關上門，獨自靜坐房中，低聲唱道：「我每靜念那十字架，並主如何在上受熬，我就不禁渾忘身家…。」於是，她的心溶化了，基督的愛使她忘了如此難忍的悲傷。這一首感人肺腑的詩歌，就是以撒華滋（Isaac Watts）不朽的傑作「我每靜念那十字架」。  

　　以撒華滋於一六七四年生於英國蘇登普登郡（Southampton），自幼即充滿脫滿傳統束縛的自由思想，他是神賜給教會的「天才」。當他年歲稍長，看到當時更正教各種聚會的光景已日益消沉、低落，漸漸落在儀文和形式中。有一次，他返鄉參加聚會，曾率直的對父親批評當時教會所唱的詩篇，於返家後即根據啟示錄第五章的背景，寫成了甚獲會眾喜愛的「頌讚被殺羔羊」，這是他最初的作品。以後的四年中，共寫了一百一十首之多，「我每靜念那十字架」就是其中感人至深的一首。  

　　這一首詩歌據說緣於一個動人的故事。一位寡婦艱辛的撫養三子成人，並且把他們都獻給主用。長子奉差至非洲傳道，不多時即被土人所殺害。她聽到這消息，沒有發出任何怨尤，只是跪在神面前讚美，**以為其子配為主殉道**。旋即打發次子承繼兄志，不久亦遭殺害。最後打發三子前往，竟也罹同樣遭遇。親友紛往探慰，友人問她：「你將三個兒子全獻與主，為福音擺上，現今他們都已殉道，**你懊悔不**？」她答道：「我很懊悔，**因我再無第四個兒子可以獻給主**。」後來她禱告說：「假若宇宙都歸我手，盡以奉主仍覺可羞。」事為以撒聽到，內心深受激勵，因此配上了深印在他心中的經節--「我斷不以別的誇口，只誇我們主耶穌基督的十字架，因這十字架就我而論，世界已經釘在十字架上；就世界而論，我已經釘在十字架上。」（加拉太書六章十四節），於是就寫成了這一首詩歌。  

　　「看從祂頭，祂腳，祂手，憂情、慈愛和血而流…看祂全身滿被水血，如同穿上朱紅衣飾…」哦，主曾流血，捨命亡躬，在十字架上忍受這樣苦難，真是憐憫何滿！慈愛何泛！恩典何其無邊！因著這首詩歌，英國名將愛德華羅伯特在一次福音聚會中，那剛硬的心也被感動，情不自禁地跪下痛泣。後來他作見證說：「我無法描述我當時唱第三節的感覺，『看從祂頭，祂腳，祂手，憂情、慈愛和血而流！』我立刻跪下大哭。我從來沒有這樣哭過，實在是基督的愛使我如此。」他的妻子為著他的得救已禱告了八年，那晚是禱告蒙應許的日子，愛德華將軍因著這首詩歌就蒙了拯救，一生謙卑地投靠在基督十架下。  

　　當教會復興之流流過英國威爾斯每一個角落的時候，幾乎每處聚會都可聽到這首詩的歌聲；凡是唱它或是聽到的人，莫不潸然淚下，如同目睹頭戴荊冕，滿被水血的基督。主的愛藉著聖靈的能力溶化了人們的心，許許多多的人因著這首歌而淚流滿面，認罪悔改，接受替他們受死的基督為救主。  

　　以撒華滋所作的詩歌前後共達六百首之多，在教會中使用後，給聚會帶來了新的生命，產生了極深遠的影響，後人即尊他為「英國聖詩之父」。愛丁堡大學且於一七二八年他榮譽博士學位，但是在以撒的心意中，只望能藉著詩歌來榮耀神，並不重此「身家」，「倨傲」。他深被基督十字架的摯愛所吸引，一生以弱病之身事主，忠心至死，未曾稍懈。一七四八年十一月廿五日歿於倫敦，葬在本恩園，與本仁約翰之墓毗鄰。  

　　他曾作一首詩歌「哎喲！救主真曾流血？」（詩歌第93首）與「我每靜念那十字架」有同樣的思想和感覺，都是說到主的受死，再引導我們當因這愛而獻上一生。主曾為我們在十字架上受熬，忍受一切苦難，對著這比死堅強，比水忍耐的大愛，我們怎能不心鎔而讚美：「主！你當得我心，我命，所有。」
