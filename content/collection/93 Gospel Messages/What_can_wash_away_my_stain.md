‪ This hymn gave me misunderstanding on definition of 'wash away'.  I always thought I put my heart into a wash machine, and clean up with Jesus's blood.  

Hebrews‬ 9:11-14 (ESV)  \
11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)   \
12 he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.   \
13 For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,   \
14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.  

希伯来书‬ 9:11-14 (和合本 2010)  \
11 但现在基督已经来到，作了已实现的美事的大祭司，经过那更大更全备的帐幕，不是人手所造，也不是属于这世界的；   \
12 他不用山羊和牛犊的血，而是用自己的血，只一次进入至圣所就获得了永远的赎罪。   \
13 若山羊和公牛的血，以及母牛犊的灰，洒在不洁的人身上，尚且使人成圣，身体洁净，   \
14 何况基督的血，他藉着永远的灵把自己无瑕疵地献给上帝，更能洗净我们 的良心，除去致死的行为，好事奉那位永生的上帝。

‪Ezekiel‬36:22-28 ESV  \
22 “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.   \
23 And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.   \
24 I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.   \
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.   \
26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.   \
27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.   \
28 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.


‪以西结书‬ 36:22-28 (和合本2010)  \
22 “所以，你要对以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：以色列家啊，我做这事不是为你们，而是为了我的圣名，就是你们在所到的列国中亵渎的。   \
23 我要使我至大的名显为圣；这名在列国中已遭亵渎，是你们在他们中间亵渎的。我在他们眼前，在你们身上显为圣的时候，他们就知道我是耶和华。这是主耶和华说的。   \
24 我必从列国带领你们，从列邦聚集你们，领你们回到本地。   \
25 我必洒清水在你们身上，你们就洁净了。我要洁净你们，使你们脱离一切的污秽，弃绝一切的偶像。   \
26 我也要赐给你们一颗新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。   \
27 我必将我的灵放在你们里面，使你们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典章。   \
28 你们必住在我所赐给你们祖先之地；你们要作我的子民，我要作你们的上帝。
