>*John 3:3 (ESV)  
Jesus answered him, “<font color ="red">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God</font>*.”



There are two layers of this verse.

1) to see the kingdom of God.   
Jesus called us out of darkness into his marvelous light.

>*1 Peter 2:9-10 (ESV)  
<sup>9</sup> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.  
<sup>10</sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.*

2) Be born again.  
Be like new garment, be like new wineskins.  
>*Luke 5:36-38 (ESV)  
<sup>36</sup> He also told them a parable: “<font color ="red">No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old</font>.  
<sup>37</sup> <font color ="red">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed</font>.  
<sup>38</sup> <font color ="red">But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins</font>*.
