<!--more-->

The first commonality between a Christian and a Canadian is citizenship.  The christian is the citizen of God's kingdom, the Canadian is the citizen of Canada.  The Canada government will protect its citizen from persecution, so will the God's kingdom.  What assurance do we have as a Christian in His kingdom!

A person can stay in Canada with a permanent resident status forever, but he/she has to apply for the citizenship, and take an oath.  For Chinese, they have to give up their Chinese citizenship, because the China government does not recognize dual citizenship.
