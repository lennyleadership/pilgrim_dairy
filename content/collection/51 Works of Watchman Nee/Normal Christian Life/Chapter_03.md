Our old history ends with the Cross; our new history begins with the resurrection. "If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold they are become new" (2 Cor 5:17). The Cross terminates the first creation, and out of death there is brought a new creation in Christ, the second Man. If we are 'in Adam' all that is in Adam necessarily devolves upon us; it becomes ours involuntarily, for we have to do nothing to get it. There is no need to make up our minds to lose our temper or to commit some other sin; it comes to us freely and despite ourselves. In a similar way, if we are 'in Christ' all that is in Christ comes to us by free grace, without effort on our part but on the ground of simple faith. 

But to say that all we need comes to us in Christ by free grace, though true enough, may seem unpractical. How does it work out in practice? How does it become real in our experience? 

As we study chapters 6, 7 and 8 of Romans we shall discover that the conditions of living the normal Christian life are fourfold. They are: (a) Knowing, (b) Reckoning, (c) Presenting ourselves to God, and (d) Walking in the Spirit, and they are set forth in that order. If we would live that life we shall have to take all four of these steps; not one nor two nor three, but all four. As we study each of them we shall trust the Lord by His Holy Spirit to illumine our understanding; and we shall seek His help now to take the first big step forward. 

## Our Death With Christ A Historic Fact 

Romans 6:1-11 is the passage before us now. In these verses it is made clear that the death of the Lord Jesus is representative and inclusive. In His death we all died. None of us can progress spiritually without seeing this. Just as we cannot have justification if we have not seen Him bearing our sins on the Cross, so we cannot have sanctification if we have not seen Him bearing us on the Cross. Not only have our sins been laid on Him but we ourselves have been put into Him. 

How did you receive forgiveness? You realized that the Lord Jesus died as your Substitute and bore your sins upon Himself, and that His Blood was shed to cleanse away your defilement. When you saw your sins all taken away on the Cross what did you do? Did you say, 'Lord Jesus, please come and die for my sins'? No, you did not pray at all; you only thanked the Lord You did not beseech Him to come and die for you, for you realized that He had already done it. 

But what is true of your forgiveness is also true of your deliverance. The work is done. There is no need to pray but only to praise. God has put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was crucified we were crucified also. Thus there is no need to pray: 'I am a very wicked person; Lord, please crucify me'. That is all wrong. You did not pray about your sins; why pray now about yourself? Your sins were dealt with by His Blood, and you were dealt with by His Cross. It is an accomplished fact. All that is left for you to do is to praise the Lord that when Christ died you died also; you died in Him. Praise Him for it and live in the light of it. "Then believed they his words: they sang his praise" (Psalm 106:12). 

Do you believe in the death of Christ? Of course you do. Well, the same Scripture that says He died for us says also that we died with Him. Look at it again: "Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). That is the first statement, and that is clear enough; but is this any less clear? "Our old man was crucified with him" (Romans 6:6). "We died with Christ" (Romans 6:8). 

When are we crucified with Him? What is the date of our old man's crucifixion? Is it tomorrow? Yesterday? Today? In order to answer this it may help us if for a moment I turn Paul's statement round and say, 'Christ was crucified with (i.e. at the same time as) our old man'. Some of you came here in twos. You traveled to this place together. You might say, My friend came here with me', but you might just as truly say, 'I came here with my friend'. Had one of you come three days ago and the other only today you could not possibly say that; but having come together you can make either statement with equal truth, because both are statements of fact. So also in historic fact we can say, reverently but with equal accuracy, 'I was crucified when Christ was crucified' or 'Christ was crucified when I was crucified', for they are not two historical events, but one. My crucifixion was "with him".[3] Has Christ been crucified? Then can I be otherwise? And if He was crucified nearly two thousand years ago, and I with Him, can my crucifixion be said to take place tomorrow? Can His be past and mine be present or future? Praise the Lord, when He died in my stead, but He bore me with Him to the Cross, so that when He died I died. And if I believe in the death of the Lord Jesus, then I can believe in my own death just as surely as I believe in His. Why do you believe that the Lord Jesus died? What is your ground for that belief? Is it that you feel He has died? No, you have never felt it. You believe it because the Word of God tells you so. When the Lord was crucified, two thieves were crucified at the same time. You do not doubt that they were crucified with Him, either, because the Scripture says so quite plainly. You believe in the death of the Lord Jesus and you believe in the death of the thieves with Him. Now what about your own death? Your crucifixion is more intimate than theirs. They were crucified at the same time as the Lord but on different crosses, whereas you were crucified on the self same cross as He, for you were in Him when He died. How can you know? You can know for the one sufficient reason that God has said so. It does not depend on your feelings. If you feel that Christ has died, He has died; and if you do not feel that he died, He has died. If you feel that you have died, you have died; and if you do not feel that you have died, you have nevertheless just as surely died. These are Divine facts. That Christ has died is a fact, that the two thieves have died is a fact, and that you have died is a fact also. Let me tell you, You have died! You are done with! You are ruled out! The self you loathe is on the Cross in Christ. And "he that is dead is freed from sin" (Romans 6:7, A.V.). This is the Gospel for Christians. Our crucifixion can never be made effective by will or by effort, but only be accepting what the Lord Jesus did on the Cross. Our eyes must be opened to see the finished work of Calvary. Some of you, prior to your salvation, may have tried to save yourselves. You read the Bible, prayed, went to Church, gave alms. Then one day your eyes were opened and you saw that a full salvation had already been provided for you on the Cross. You just accepted that and thanked God, and peace and joy flowed into your heart. Now salvation and sanctification are on exactly the same basis. You receive deliverance from sin in the same way as you receive forgiveness of sins. For God's way of deliverance is altogether different from man's way. Man's way is to try to suppress sin by seeking to overcome it; God's way is to remove the sinner. Many Christians mourn over their weakness, thinking that if only they were stronger all would be well. The idea that, because failure to lead a holy life is due to our impotence, something more is therefore demanded of us, leads naturally to this false conception of the way of deliverance. If we are preoccupied with the power of sin and with our inability to meet it, then we naturally conclude that to gain the victory over sin we must have more power. 'If only I were stronger', we say, 'I could overcome my violent outbursts of temper', and so we plead with the Lord to strengthen us that we may exercise more self control. But this is altogether wrong; this is not Christianity. God's means of delivering us from sin is not by making us stronger and stronger, but by making us weaker and weaker. That is surely rather a peculiar way of victory, you say; but it is the Divine way. God sets us free from the dominion of sin, not by strengthening our old man but by crucifying him; not by helping him to do anything but by removing him from the scene of action. For years, maybe, you have tried fruitlessly to exercise control over yourself, and perhaps this is still your experience; but when once you see the truth you will recognize that you are indeed powerless to do anything, but that in setting you aside altogether God has done it all. Such a revelation brings human self-effort to an end. 

## The First Step: "Knowing This..." 

The normal Christian life must begin with a very definite 'knowing', which is not just knowing something about the truth nor understanding some important doctrine. It is not intellectual knowledge at all, but an opening of the eyes of the heart to see what we have in Christ. How do you know your sins are forgiven? Is it because your pastor told you so? No, you just know it. If I ask you how you know, you simply answer, 'I know it!' Such knowledge comes by Divine revelation. It comes from the Lord Himself. Of course the fact of forgiveness of sins is in the Bible, but for the written Word of God to become a living Word from God to you He had to give you "a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him" (Eph. 1:17). What you needed was to know Christ in that way, and it is always so. So there comes a time, in regard to any new apprehension of Christ, when you know it in your own heart, you 'see' it in your spirit. A light has shined into your inner being and you are wholly persuaded of the fact. What is true of the forgiveness of your sins is no less true of your deliverance from sin. When once the light of God dawns upon your heart you see yourself in Christ. It is not now because someone has told you, and not merely because Romans 6 says so. It is something more even than that. You know it because God has revealed it to you by His Spirit. You may not feel it; you may not understand it; but you know it, for you have seen it. Once you have seen yourself in Christ, nothing can shake your assurance of that blessed fact. If you ask a number of believers who have entered upon the normal Christian life how they came by their experience, some will say in this way and some will say in that. Each stresses his own particular way of entering in and produces Scripture to support his experience; and unhappily many Christians are using their special experiences and their special scriptures to fight other Christians. The fact of the matter is that, while Christians may enter into the deeper life by different ways, we need not regard the experiences or doctrines they stress as mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. One thing is certain, that any true experience of value in the sight of God must have been reached by way of a new discovery of the meaning of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus. That is a crucial test and a safe one. And here in our passage Paul makes everything depend upon such a discovery. "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin" (Romans 6:6). 

## Divine Revelation Essential To Knowledge 

So our first step is to seek from God a knowledge that comes by revelation -- a revelation, that is to say, not of ourselves but of the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross. When Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, entered into the normal Christian life it was thus that he did so. You remember how he tells of his long-standing problem of how to live 'in Christ', how to draw the sap out of the Vine into himself. For he knew that he must have the life of Christ flowing out through him and yet felt that he had not got it, and he saw clearly enough that his need was to be found in Christ. 'I knew', he said, writing to his sister from Chinkiang in 1869, 'that if only I could abide in Christ, all would be well, but I could not.' The more he tried to get in the more he found himself slipping out, so to speak, until one day light dawned, revelation came and he saw. 'Here, I feel, is the secret: not asking how I am to get sap out of the Vine into myself, but remembering that Jesus is the Vine -- the root, stem, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruit, all indeed.' Then, in words of a friend that had helped him: 'I have not got to make myself a branch. The Lord Jesus tells me I am a branch. I am part of Him and I have just to believe it and act upon it. I have seen it long enough in the Bible, but I believe it now as a living reality.' It was as though something which had indeed been true all the time had now suddenly become true in a new way to him personally, and he writes to his sister again: 'I do not know how far I may be able to make myself intelligible about it, for there is nothing new or strange or wonderful -- and yet, all is new! In a word, "whereas once I was blind, now I see"....I am dead and buried with Christ -- aye, and risen too and ascended....God reckons me so, and tells me to reckon myself so. He knows best....Oh, the joy of seeing this truth -- I do pray that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened, that you may know and enjoy the riches freely given us in Christ.'[4] Oh, it is a great thing to see that we are in Christ! Think of the bewilderment of trying to get into a room in which you already are! Think of the absurdity of asking to be put in! If we recognize the fact that we are in, we make no effort to enter. If we had more revelation we should have fewer prayers and more praises. Much of our praying for ourselves is just because we are blind to what God has done. I remember one day in Shanghai I was talking with a brother who was very exercised concerning his spiritual state. He said, 'So many are living beautiful, saintly lives. I am ashamed of myself. I call myself a Christian and yet when I compare myself with others I feel I am not one at all. I want to know this crucified life, this resurrection life, but I do not know it and see no way of getting there.' Another brother was with us, and the two of us had been talking for two hours or so, trying to get the man to see that he could not have anything apart from Christ, but without success. Said our friend, 'the best thing a man can do is to'pray.' 'But if God has already given you everything, what do you need to pray for?' we asked. 'He hasn't', the man replied, 'for I am still losing my temper, still failing constantly; so I must pray more.' 'Well', we said, 'do you get what you pray for?' 'I am sorry to say that I do not get anything', he replied. We tried to point out that, just as he had done nothing for his justification, so he need do nothing for his sanctification. Just then a third brother, much used of the Lord, came in and joined us. There was a thermos flask on the table, and this brother picked it up and said, 'What is this?' 'A thermos flask.' 'Well, you just imagine for a moment that this thermos flask can pray, and that it starts praying something like this: "Lord, I want very much to be a thermos flask. Wilt Thou make me to be a thermos flask? Lord, give me grace to become a thermos flask. Do please make me one!" What will you say?' 'I do not think even a thermos flask would be so silly,' our friend replied. 'It would be nonsense to pray like that; it is a thermos flask!' Then my brother said, 'You are doing the same thing. God in times past has already included you in Christ. When He died, you died; when He lived, you lived. Now today you cannot say, "I want to die; I want to be crucified; I want to have resurrection life." The Lord simply looks at you and says, "You are dead! You have new life!" All your praying is just as absurd as that of the thermos flask. You do not need to pray to the Lord for anything; you merely need your eyes opened to see that He has done it all.' That is the point. We need not work to die, we need not wait to die, we are dead. We only need to recognize what the Lord has already done and to praise Him for it. Light dawned for that man. With tears in his eyes he said, 'Lord, I praise Thee that Thou hast already included me in Christ. All that is His is mine!' Revelation had come and faith had something to lay hold of; and if you could have met that brother later on, what a change you would have found! 

## The Cross Goes To The Root Of Our Problem 

Let me remind you again of the fundamental nature of that which the Lord has done on the Cross. I feel I cannot press this point too much for we must see it. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the government of your country should wish to deal drastically with the question of strong drink and should decide that the whole country was to go 'dry', how could the decision be carried into effect? How could we help? If we were to search every shop and house throughout the land and smash all the bottles of wine or beer or brandy we came across, would that meet the case? Surely not. We might thereby rid the land of every drop of alcoholic liquor it contains, but behind those bottles of strong drink are the factories that produce them, and if we only deal with the bottles and leave the factories untouched, production will still continue and there is no permanent solution of the problem. The drink-producing factories, the breweries and distilleries throughout the land, must be closed down if the drink question is to be permanently settled. 

We are the factory; our actions are the products. The Blood of the Lord Jesus dealt with the question of the products, namely, our sins. So the question of what we have done is settled, but would God have stopped there? What about the question of what we are? Our sins were produced by us. They have been dealt with, but how are we going to be dealt with? Do you believe the Lord would cleanse away all our sins and then leave us to get rid of the sin-producing factory? Do you believe He would put away the goods produced but leave us to deal with the source of production? To ask this question is but to answer it. Of course He has not done half the work and left the other half undone. No, He has done away with the goods and also made a clean sweep of the factory that produces the goods. The finished work of Christ really has gone to the root of our problem and dealt with it. There are no half measures with God. "Knowing this," says Paul, "That our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin" (Rom. 6:6). "Knowing this"! Yes, but do you know it? "Or are ye ignorant?" (Rom. 6:3). May the Lord graciously open our eyes.

<div id="chinese" class="tabcontent">
我们的旧历史在十字架上结束了；我们的新历史从复活开始。“若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人；旧事已过，都变成新的了。”（林后五17）十字架结束了第一个创造，从死里出来的，乃是在基督里的新造，就是第二个人。如果我们在亚当里，所有在亚当里面的一切，必然传给我们。这事出诸自然，我们不必作什么，就都获得了。正如我们从来不必为着发脾气，或者犯别的罪先下决心；它自由地临到我们，不问我们自己是否愿意。同样的原则，如果我们在基督里，在基督里的一切，也都白白地赐给我们，无需我们努力去作什么，只要信就行了。

但是说到我们所需要的一切，已经在基督里白白地赐给我们了，虽然这说法是真实的，却好象有点不实际。怎样才能使它成为实际呢？怎样才能使它在我们的经历中，成为真实的呢？

当我们读罗马六、七、八这三章圣经的时候，我们会发现，过正常基督徒生活的条件有四：(1)知道，(2)计算，(3)将自己献给神，(4)在灵里行。它们的次序正是这样排列的。如果我们要过这种生活，我们必须全部采取这四个步骤；不是一个，不是两个，也不是三个，乃是四个。现在我们要仔细地来看每一个步骤。我们仰望主借着祂的圣灵，光照我们的悟性。现在我们寻求祂的帮助，先来看第一大步骤。

## <center>**<font color =#3fb5bd>我们与基督同死是一件历史的事实</font>**</center>

现在在我们面前的是罗马六章一至十一节。经上的话清楚地说出，主耶稣的死是代表的与包括的。在祂的死里面，我们都死了。看不见这一点的人，在属灵上没有办法进步。正如我们没有看见祂在十字架上背负了我们的罪，就不能称义；照样，我们若没有看见祂在十字架上背负了我们，也不能成圣。不只我们的罪已经归在祂身上，连我们自己也归入祂里面了。

你是怎样得着罪的赦免呢？岂不是因为知道主耶稣在十字架上背负了你的罪，作了你的代替，祂流血为洗净你的污秽么？当你看见你的罪已经全被拿去放在十字架上，你还要作什么呢？你还要说，“主耶稣，求你来为我的罪死”么？不，你根本不必祷告；你只感谢主就行了。*<font color ="blue">你不必求祂来为你死，因为你知道祂已经为你死了</font>*。

罪得赦免是如何，从罪里得释放也是如何。工作已经完成了。*<font color ="blue">我们用不着祷告</font>*，只要赞美就够了。神已经把我们都放在基督里面，所以*<font color ="blue">当基督钉十字架的时候，我们也都钉了十字架</font>*。因此我们不需要再祷告说，“主啊，我是一个十分邪恶的人，求你把我钉在十字架上。”这样求就完全错了。你既不为你的罪祷告，为什么又为你的自己祷告呢？你的罪已经被祂的血对付了，你的自己已经被祂的十字架对付了，这是一件已成的事实。当基督死了的时候，你也死了，你已经在祂里面死了，所以你只要赞美主就够了。你要为这件事赞美祂，并要活在这光的里面。“那时他们才信了祂的话，歌唱赞美祂。”（诗一○六12）

你信基督的死么？当然你是信的。很好，*<font color ="blue">圣经不只说祂为我们死，圣经也说我们与祂同死</font>*。让我们再看圣经怎样说，“基督……为我们死。”（罗五8）这是第一个说明，已经够清楚了；圣经又说，“我们的旧人，和祂同钉十字架。”（六6）“我们……与基督同死。”（8）

我们是什么时候，与祂同钉十字架的呢？我们的旧人是哪一天钉死的呢？是明天么？是昨天么？还是今天？为着要回答这个问题，我们不妨把保罗的话倒过来试试看，这样也许会更清楚，那就是说，“基督与我们的旧人同时钉十字架。”有些人到这里来的时候，是两个两个来的，你们是一起来的，你可以这样说，“我的朋友与我同来。”你也可以说，“我与我的朋友同来。”如果你们之中有一个是三天前来的，而另一个是今天才来，那么你就不能这样说了；如果你们是一起来的，随便你怎样说，都是对的，因为两种说法都说到一个事实。所以就着历史的事实来说，我们可以恭敬地说，“当基督钉十字架的时候，我也钉了十字架”，或者说，“当我钉十字架的时候，基督也钉了十字架”。这两种说法同样是准确的，因为它们不是两件历史上的事，乃是一件。我与祂同钉十字架（注）。基督钉了十字架没有呢？基督既然已经钉了十字架，我怎么能没有钉呢？如果祂在将近二千年前钉了十字架，而我又是与祂同钉的，还能说我明天才钉十字架么？祂的钉十字架是过去的，我的能是现在的或是将来的么？赞美主，当祂死在十字架时，我与祂同死了。祂的死不仅是代替我死，并且把我和祂一同挂在十字架上，所以祂死了，我也死了。如果我相信主耶稣死了，我就能够相信我自己也死了，象相信祂死了那样的确实。

你为什么相信主耶稣死了呢？你那样相信有什么根据呢？你感觉到祂死了么？我信你从来没有感觉到过。你相信主耶稣死了，因为神的话这样告诉你。当主钉在十字架上的时候，有两个强盗同时被钉。你也没有怀疑过他们与祂同钉，因为圣经很明白地这样说。

你相信主耶稣的死，你也相信两个强盗与祂同钉死，那么你对于你自己的死怎么样呢？你的与主同钉，比起他们的同钉更亲密。他们虽然与主同时钉十字架，却是在不同的十字架上，*<font color ="blue">而你是和主钉在同一个十字架上</font>*，因为当祂死的时候，你是在祂的里面。你怎么能够知道呢？你有足够理由知道这事，因为神如此说了。这一点都不在于你的感觉。无论你感觉到基督已经死了，或者你不感到祂已经死了，基督总归已经死了。同样的原则，无论你感觉到你已经死了，或者你不感觉到你已经死了，你也确实已经死了。这些乃是神圣的事实。基督已经死了是一件事实，两个强盗已经死了也是一件事实，*<font color ="blue">你已经死了也是一件事实</font>*。让我告诉你，你已经死了！你已经被除掉了！你已经被废弃了！你所不喜欢的自己已经在基督里挂在十字架上了！“已死的人，是脱离了罪。”（罗六7）这是基督徒的福音！

我们无法借着意志或努力使我们钉十字架的事实发生功效，惟有接受主耶稣在十字架上所成的才能。我们的眼睛必须开启，看见主在髑髅地所完成的工作。有些人在得救之前，可能曾经试着要自己救自己。你读经、祷告、去礼拜堂并施舍。然而有一天，你的眼睛开启了，看见在十字架上主已经为你预备了完满的救赎。你就接受了，感谢神，平安与快乐便涌进了你的心。要知道救赎与成圣完全是在同一个根基上。你从罪里得着释放的途径，正如你得着罪的赦免一样。

因为神拯救的方法与人的方法完全不同。人的方法是要借着胜过罪而压制罪；神的方法是把罪人去掉。许多基督徒为他们的软弱悲伤，他们以为只要他们能够刚强一点，一切就都好了。他们以为他们之所以不能过圣洁的生活，乃是由于他们的软弱无能，所以就向自己有更多的要求。这是一个错误的观念。如果我们对于罪的能力和我们的无力应对，预先有了成见，我们就很自然会有这样的结论：要胜过罪必须有更多的能力。我们常常这样说，“只要我刚强一点，我就可以克制我暴躁的脾气。”所以我们求神刚强我们，使我们更能自制。

但是这完全是错误的；这不是基督教。神拯救我们脱离罪，不是借着使我们越过越刚强，反而是使我们越过越软弱。你要说这实在是一个奇特的制胜之法，然而这是神的方法。神使我们脱离罪的辖制，不是借着刚强我们的旧人，*<font color ="blue">乃是借着钉死他</font>*；不是借着帮助他作什么事，*<font color ="blue">反而是借着不让他作什么</font>*。

也许多年来，你试着要控制你自己而毫无结果，也许到如今你仍然是在这样地努力着；但是当你一看见了这个真理，你就会承认，你实在无论作什么都是毫无能力，神已经把你完全摆在一边，祂已经什么都作成了。这样的启示就结束了人自己的努力。

## <center>**<font color =#3fb5bd>第一步：“知道……”</font>**</center>

正常的基督徒生活必须以确定的知道为开始，这不是仅仅知道一些关于真理的事，也不是明白一些重要的教义。这一个确定的知道完全不是一种智识的学问，乃是心中眼睛的开启，看见我们在基督里所有的一切。

你怎么知道你的罪已经蒙了赦免呢？是不是因为传道人这样告诉你的？不，你就是知道你的罪已经蒙了赦免。如果我问你，你是怎样知道的呢？你会回答说，“我知道就是了！”这种智识是从神的启示来的，也就是从主自己来的。当然，罪得赦免这件事，清楚地记载在圣经的里面，但是神为着要叫祂所写出来的话，成为祂对你所说活的话，祂就必须将认识祂的智慧和启示的灵（弗一17，另译）赐给你。你所需要的就是在智慧和启示的灵里来知道基督，并且一直要如此。你如果这样，到了一个时候，你对基督任何新的了解，当你在心里知道的时候，也就是你在灵里看见的时候。有亮光照进你的内心，你就完全相信了。从罪里得释放和罪得赦免，在原则上完全是一样的。当神的光照亮了你的心，你就看见你自己是在基督里。这不仅是因为有人这样告诉你，也不仅是因为罗马六章里面是这样说的，不，比这些更多。你所以知道你是在基督里，因为神已经借着祂的灵把它启示给你了。可能你对这件事并没有什么感觉，你也可能不明白；但是你知道，因为你已经看见了。一旦你看见了你自己在基督里，任何事物都不能动摇你对于那件蒙福事实的信心。

如果你问那些已经进入正常基督徒生活的信徒，他们进入的经历是怎样的，有些人会这样说，也有些人会那样说。每个人都强调他特有的方法，并且引圣经来支持他的经历；不幸竟有许多基督徒用他们特别的经历，与特别的经文，来攻击别的基督徒。事实是基督徒可以用不同的方法，进入更深的生命，所以不要以为他们所强调的经历或真理是彼此排斥的，不如说那些是互相补充的。一件事是确定的，任何在神看来有真实价值的经历，一定是借着对于主耶稣的身位和工作有了新的发现而达到的。这是一个厉害的考验，也是一个稳妥的考验。

在我们所读过的经文里，保罗将每一件事都溯源于这一种发现：“因为知道我们的旧人，和祂同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。”（罗六6）

## <center>**<font color =#3fb5bd>神的启示对智识的重要</font>**</center>

所以我们的第一步，乃是要寻求从神那里由启示而来的智识—就是启示—不是关于我们自己的，乃是关于主耶稣基督在十字架上所完成的工作。内地会的发起人戴德生弟兄，进入正常的基督徒生活的时候，他就是这样的。你们记得他说到他一直有一个问题，就是怎样活在基督里，怎样从葡萄树将汁液吸取到他里面。因为他知道，基督的生命必须经过他而从他里面流出来，但是他感觉到他还没有得着。他很清楚地看见，他的需要只能在基督里找到。一八六九年，他在镇江写信给他的妹妹说，“我知道，只要我能住在基督里，一切就都好了，但是我却不能够！”当他越是要进入，他就越发觉得自己滑出来，直到有一天，光来照亮，启示临到，他就看见了。

他说，“我感觉到秘诀在此！不是我设法怎样从葡萄树将树汁吸入我的里面，乃是记得主耶稣就是葡萄树—祂是根、干、枝、小枝、叶、花、果以及一切。”

他又写给曾经帮助他的一个朋友说，“我无需使我自己成为一个枝子。主耶稣告诉我，我是枝子，是祂的一部分。我只要相信这件事，并照着行就可以了。我早就在圣经里读到它，但是我现在相信这是一个活的实际。”

这件事虽然一直都是真实的，现在却忽然对他个人，在一种新的途径中成为真实的经历。他再写给他的妹妹说，“我不知道我能够说明多少，这似乎没有什么新奇或奇异—然而如今这一切对于我都是新的—总而言之，从前我是眼瞎的，如今能看见了。……我死了，与基督一同埋葬了—也一同与祂复活了，并且升到天上……神是这样地看我，祂告诉我也要这样看我自己。祂最知道……啊，看见这真理是何等的喜乐！求主照亮你悟性里面的眼睛，使你能知道并享受，我们在基督里所白白得到的丰盛。”

哦，看见我们是在基督里，这是一件大事。试想一想，你已经在房里，却还在那里想法子进入，这是何等的糊涂！我们求主将我们放在基督里，这是何等的可笑！如果我们认识我们在基督里的事实，我们便不会再为着要进入而努力了。如果我们有更多的启示，我们就会少一些祈求，而多一点赞美了。我们所以有许多为自己的祈求，就是因为我们没有看见神所已经作成的。

我记得我在上海的时候，有一天我和一个很关心他自己属灵光景的弟兄谈话。他说，“这么多人都过着美丽的圣徒生活，我真为自己惭愧。我自称为基督徒，但是当我把自己和别人比一比，我就觉得我一点也不是。我真愿认识这钉十字架的生命，和这复活的生命，但是到如今我还不认识，也不知道怎么样才能认识。”当时还有另一位弟兄同我们在一起，我们两个人说了差不多两个钟头，想设法让这个人看见，离开基督他什么也得不到。但是我们的企图没有成功。他说，“人所能作的最好就是祈求了。”我们就问他说，“如果已经把什么都给你了，你为什么还要祈求呢？”他回答说，“祂还没有都给，因为我还发脾气，仍然不断地失败；所以我要更多地祈求。”我们说，“那么你有没有得着你所求的呢？”他回答说，“我很难过，到如今我仍然什么也没有得着。”到这时，我们就设法指给他看，对于他的称义，他如何什么也没有作，照样，对于他的成圣，他也用不着作什么。

正在这时候，有一位蒙主重用的弟兄，过来参加我们的谈话。桌子上有一个热水瓶，这位弟兄拿起热水瓶来对他说，“这是什么呢？”“热水瓶。”“不错。假定这个热水瓶会祷告，它这样祷告说，‘主啊，我非常愿意作一个热水瓶，你肯不肯使我成为一个热水瓶？主啊，求你给我恩典，使我成为一个热水瓶。’请你说，你听了这样的祷告，你要怎么说？”我们的朋友回答说，“我想热水瓶绝不会这么愚蠢。这样的祷告是毫无意义的；它就是一个热水瓶呀！”于是这位弟兄就说，“你正在作着同样的事。神早已把你包括在基督里。当基督死的时候，你死了；祂从死里复活，你也复活了。现在你不能再说，‘我要死；我要钉十字架；我要有复活的生命。’神说，‘你已经死了！你有了新的生命！’你的一切祈求，就象那热水瓶的祷告一样可笑。你用不着向主祈求什么，你只要睁开你的眼睛，看祂已经把一切都作好了。”

关键就在这里。我们无需想办法死，也无需等着死，我们原是死的。我们只要认识主所已经作成的，并赞美祂就够了。主借着这些话开了他的眼，如同曙光拨开黑暗，他流着眼泪说，“主啊，我赞美你，你已经把我包括在基督里，祂的一切也是我的！”他得着了启示，信心有了把握。哦，如果此后你曾遇见那个弟兄，你会发现他有了何等的改变！

让我再提醒你，基督在十字架上所成就之事的基本性质。关乎这一点，我觉得我总不至说得过分，我们必须有看见。

我们用一个比喻来说它。比方我们的政府希望严格地对付酗酒的问题，决定全国禁酒。试问要怎样执行这个决定呢？我们要怎么办呢？如果我们到各地去搜查每个商店，遇见酒瓶就打碎，这样可以解决问题么？当然不能。这样作虽然可以去掉各地酒瓶里面的每一滴酒，但是在那些酒瓶的后面，还有出产酒的酒厂。如果我只对付酒瓶，而留下酒厂不对付，那样酒就必然继续源源出产，问题还不能解决。如果喝酒的问题要永远解决，全国的酿酒厂就必须关闭。

用比方来说，我们是工厂，我们的行为就是产品。主耶稣的血是对付产品的问题，那就是我们的罪行。所以我们所作的是解决了。神会停在这里么？我们所是的问题怎么样呢？我们的罪行是由我们产生的。这些罪行已经受了对付，那么我们要怎样受对付呢？你能相信主洗净了我们一切的罪行，却让我们自己去除掉产生罪行的工厂么？你能相信祂拿走了所出产的货物，却让我们去对付出产的源头么？

这样的发问正好回答了这问题。当然，主从来不把工作只作一半，而留下另一半不作。不，祂已经除掉货物，也清除了生产货物的工厂。

基督所完成的工作，真正已经摸着我们问题的根源，并且已经对付了它。神绝不会只作一半的。保罗说，“因为知道我们的旧人，和祂同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。”（罗六6）是的，“知道”。但是你知道么？或者你仍是不知！“岂不知……？”（3）愿主赐恩开启我们的眼睛。
