We have seen that Romans 1 to 8 falls into two sections, in the first of which we are shown that the Blood deals with what we have done, while in the second we shall see that the Cross <sup>[2]</sup> deals with what we are. We need the Blood for forgiveness; we need also the Cross for deliverance. We have dealt briefly above with the first of these two and we shall move on now to the second; but before we do so, we will look for a moment at a few more features of this passage which serve to emphasize the difference in subject matter and argument between the two halves.  

## Some Further Distinctions  
Two aspects of the resurrection are mentioned in the two sections, in chapters 4 and 6. In Romans 4:25 the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is mentioned in relation to our justification: "Jesus our Lord...was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification." <span style="text-decoration:underline">Here the matter in view is that of our standing before God</span>. But in Romans 6:4 the resurrection is spoken of as imparting to us new life with a view to a holy walk: "That like as Christ was raised from the dead...so we also might walk in newness of life." 
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Here the matter before us is behaviour</span>.  

Again, peace is spoken of in both sections, in the fifth and eighth chapters. Romans 5 tells of peace with God which is the effect of justification by faith in His Blood: "Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." (5:1mg.) This means that, now that I have forgiveness of sins, God will no longer be a cause of dread and trouble to me. I who was an enemy to God have been "reconciled...through the death of his Son" (5:10). I very soon find, however, that I am going to be a great cause of trouble to myself. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***There is still unrest within***</span>, for within me there is something that draws me to sin. <span style="text-decoration:underline">There is peace with God, but there is no peace with myself</span>. There is in fact civil war in my own heart. This condition is well depicted in Romans 7 where the flesh and the spirit are seen to be in deadly conflict within me. But from this the argument leads in chapter 8 to the inward peace of a walk in the Spirit. "The mind of the flesh is death", because it "is enmity against God", "but the mind of the spirit is life and peace" (Romans 8:6,7).  

Looking further still we find that the first half of the section deals generally speaking with the question of justification (see, for example, Romans 3:24-26; 4:5,25), while the second half has as its main topic the corresponding question of sanctification (see Rom. 6:19,22). When we know the precious truth of justification by faith we still know only half of the story. We still have only solved <span style="text-decoration:underline">the problem of our standing before God</span>. As we go on, God has something more to offer us, namely, the solution of <span style="text-decoration:underline">the problem of our conduct</span>, and the development of thought in these chapters serves to emphasize this. In each case the second step follows from the first, and if we know only the first then we are still leading a sub-normal Christian life. ***How then can we live a normal Christian life?*** How do we enter in? Well, of course, initially we must have forgiveness of sins, we must have justification, we must have peace with God: these are our indispensable foundation. But with that basis truly established through our first act of faith in Christ, it is yet clear from the above that we must move on to something more.   

So we see that objectively the Blood deals with *our sins*. The Lord Jesus has borne them on the Cross for us as our Substitute and has thereby obtained for us forgiveness, justification and reconciliation. But we must now go a step further in the plan of God to understand how He deals with *the sin principle in us*. The Blood can wash away my sins, but it cannot wash away my `old man'. It needs the Cross to crucify me. *<font color ="blue">The Blood deals with the sins, but the Cross must deal with the sinner</font>*.

You will scarcely find the word 'sinner' in the first four chapters of Romans. This is because there the sinner himself is not mainly in view, but rather the sins he has committed. The word 'sinner' first comes into prominence only in chapter 5, and it is important to notice how the sinner is there introduced. In that chapter a sinner is said to be a sinner because he is born a sinner; not because he has committed sins. The distinction is important. It is true that often when a Gospel worker wants to convince a man in the street that he is a sinner, he will use the favourite verse Romans 3:23, where it says that "all have sinned"; but this use of the verse is not strictly justified by the Scriptures. Those who so use it are in danger or arguing the wrong way round, for the teaching of Romans is not that we are sinners because we commit sins, but that *we sin because we are sinners*. We are sinners by constitution rather than by action. As Romans 5:19 expresses it: "Through the one man's disobedience the man were made (or `constituted') sinners".   

 How were we constituted sinners? By Adam's disobedience. We do not become sinners by what we have done but because of what Adam has done and has become. I speak English, but I am not thereby constituted on Englishman. I am in fact a Chinese. So chapter 3 draws our attention to what we have done -- "all have sinned" -- but it is not because we have done it that we become sinners.   

 I once asked a class of children. 'Who is a sinner?' and their immediate reply was, `One who sins'. Yes, one who sins is a sinner, but the fact that he sins is merely the evidence that he is already a sinner; it is not the cause. One who sins is a sinner, but it is equally true that one who does not sin, if he is of Adam's race, is a sinner too, and in need of redemption. Do you follow me? There are **bad sinners** and there are **good sinners**, there are **moral sinners** and there are **corrupt sinners**, but they are all alike sinners. We sometimes think that if only we had not done certain things all would be well; but the trouble lies far deeper than in what we do: it lies in what we are. A Chinese may be born America and be unable to speak Chinese at all, but he is a Chinese for all that, because he was born a Chinese. **It is birth that counts**. So I am a sinner not of my behaviour but of my heredity, my parentage. I am not a sinner because I sin, but I sin because I come of the wrong stock. I sin because I am a sinner.   

 We are apt to think that what we have done is very bad, but that we ourselves are not so bad. God is taking pains to show us that we ourselves are wrong, fundamentally wrong. The root trouble is the sinner; he must be dealt with. ***Our sins are dealt with by the Blood, but we ourselves are dealt with by the Cross. The Blood procures our pardon for what we have done; the Cross procures our deliverance from what we are***.   

## Man's State By Nature  

We come therefore to Romans 5:12-21. In this great passage, grace is brought into contrast with sin and the obedience of Christ is set against the disobedience of Adam. It is placed at the beginning of the second section of Romans (5:12 to 8:39) with which we shall now be particularly concerned, and its argument leads to a conclusion which lies at the foundation of our further meditations. What is that conclusion? It is found in verse 19 already quoted: "For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous." Here the Spirit of God is seeking to show us first what we are, and then how we came to be what we are.   

**At the beginning of our Christian life we are concerned with our doing, not with our being**; we are distressed rather by what we have done than by what we are. We think that if only we could rectify certain things we should be good Christians, and we set out therefore to change our actions. But the result is not what we expected. We discover to our dismay that it is something more than just a case of trouble on the outside -- that there is in fact more serious trouble on the inside. We try to please the Lord, but find something within that does not want to please Him. We try to be humble, but there is something in our very being that refuses to be humble. We try to be loving, but inside we feel most unloving. We smile and try to look very gracious, but inwardly we feel decidedly ungracious. The more we try to rectify matters on the outside the more we realize how deep-seated the trouble is within. Then we come to the Lord and say, 'Lord, I see it now! Not only what I have *done* is wrong; I am wrong.'   

The conclusion of Romans 5:19 is beginning to dawn upon us. We are sinners. We are members of a race of people who are constitutionally other than what God intended them to be. By the Fall a fundamental change took place in the character of Adam whereby he became a sinner, one constitutionally unable to please God; and the family likeness which we all share is no merely superficial one but extends to our inward character also. We have been "constituted sinners". How did this come about? "By the disobedience of one", says Paul. Let me try to illustrate this.   

 My name is Nee. It is a fairly common Chinese name. How did I come by it? I did not choose it. I did not go through the list of possible Chinese names and select this one. That my name is Nee is in fact not my doing at all, and, moreover, nothing I can do can alter it. I am a Nee because my father was a Nee, and my father was a Nee because my grandfather was a Nee. If I act like a Nee I am a Nee, and if I act unlike a Nee I am still a 
Nee. If I become President of the Chinese Republic I am a Nee, or if I become a beggar in the street I am still a Nee. Nothing I do or refrain from doing will make me other than a Nee.   

 We are sinners not because of ourselves but because of Adam. It is not because I individually have sinned that I am a sinner but because I was in Adam when he sinned. Because by birth I come of Adam, therefore I am a part of him. What is more, I can do nothing to alter this. I cannot by improving my behaviour make myself other than a part of Adam and so a sinner.   

 In China I was once talking in this strain and remarked, 'We have all sinned in Adam'. A man said, 'I don't understand', so I sought to explain it in this way. 'All Chinese trace their descent from Huang-ti', I said. 'Over four thousand years ago he had a war with Si-iu. His enemy was very strong, but nevertheless Huang-ti overcame and slew him. After this Huang-ti founded the Chinese nation. Four thousand years ago therefore our nation was founded by Huang-ti. Now what would have happened if Huang-ti had not killed his enemy, but had been himself killed instead? Where would you be now?' 'There would be no me at all', he answered. 'Oh, no! Huang-ti can die his death and you can live your life.' 'Impossible!' he cried, 'If he had died, then I could never have lived, for I have derived my life from him.'   
 
 Do you see the oneness of human life? Our life comes from Adam. If your great grandfather had died at the age of three, where would you be? You would have died in him! Your experience is bound up with his. Now in just the same way the experience of every one of us is bound up with that of Adam. None can say, `I have not been in Eden' for potentially we all were there when Adam yielded to the serpent's words. So we are all involved in Adam's sin, and by being born "in Adam" we receive from him all that he became as a result of his sin -- that is to say, the Adam-nature which is the nature of a sinner. We derive our existence from him, and because his life became a sinful life, a sinful nature, therefore the nature which we derive from him is also sinful. So, as we have said, the trouble is in our heredity, not in our behaviour. Unless we can change our parentage there is no deliverance for us.   

 But it is in this very direction that we shall find the solution of our problem, for that is exactly how God has dealt with the situation.   

## As In Adam So In Christ   
 In Romans 5:12 to 21 we are not only told something about Adam; we are told also something about the Lord Jesus. "As through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous." In Adam we receive everything that is of Adam; in Christ we receive everything that is of Christ.   

 The terms 'in Adam' and 'in Christ' are too little understood by Christians, and, at the risk of repetition, I wish again to emphasize by means of an illustration the hereditary and racial significance of the term `in Christ'. This illustration is to be found in the letter to the Hebrews. Do you remember that in the earlier part of the letter the writer is trying to show that Melchizedek is greater than Levi? You recall that the point to be proved is that the priesthood of Christ is greater than the priesthood of Aaron who was of the tribe of Levi. Now in order to prove that, he has first to prove that the priesthood of Melchizedek is greater than the priesthood of Levi, for the simple reason that the priesthood of Christ is "after the order of Melchizedek" (Heb. 7:14-17), while that of Aaron is, of course, after the order of Levi. If the writer can demonstrate to us that Melchizedek is greater than Levi, then he has made his point. That is the issue, and he proves it in a remarkable way.   

 He tells us in Hebrews chapter 7 that one day Abraham, returning from the battle of the kings (Genesis 14), offered a tithe of his spoils to Melchizedek and received from him a blessing. Inasmuch as Abraham did so, Levi is therefore of less account than Melchizedek. Why? Because the fact that Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek. But if that is true, then Jacob also 'in Abraham' offered to Melchizedek, which in turn means that Levi 'in Abraham' offered to Melchizedek. It is evident that the lesser offers to the greater (Hebrews 7:7). So Levi is less in standing than Melchizedek, and therefore the priesthood of Aaron is inferior to that of the Lord Jesus. Levi at the time of the battle of the kings was not yet even thought of. Yet he was "in the loins of his father" Abraham, and, "so to say, through Abraham", he offered (Hebrews 7:9,10).   

 Now his is the exact meaning of 'in Christ'. Abraham, as the head of the family of faith, includes the whole family in himself. When he offered to Melchizedek, the whole family offered in him to Melchizedek. They did not offer separately as individuals, but they were in him, and therefore in making his offering he included with himself all his seed.   

 So we are presented with a `new possibility`. In Adam all was lost. Through the disobedience of one man we were all constituted sinners. By him sin entered and death through sin, and throughout the race sin has reigned unto death from that day on. But now a ray of light is cast upon the scene. Through the obedience of Another we may be constituted righteous. Where sin abounded grace did much more abound, and as sin reigned unto death, even so may grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 5:19-21). Our despair is in Adam; our hope is in Christ.   

## The Divine Way of Deliverance 
 God clearly intends that this consideration should lead to our practical deliverance from sin. Paul makes this quite plain when he opens chapter 6 of his letter with the question: "Shall we continue in sin?" His whole being recoils at the very suggestion. "God forbid!", he exclaims. How could a holy God be satisfied to have unholy, sin-fettered children? And so "how shall we any longer live therein?" (Romans 6:1,2). God has surely therefore made adequate provision that we should be set free from sin's dominion.   

 But here is our problem. We were born sinners; how then can we cut off our sinful heredity? Seeing that we were born in Adam, how can we get out of Adam? Let me say at once, the Blood cannot take us out of Adam. There is only one way. Since we came in by birth we must go out by death. To do away with our sinfulness we must do away with our life. Bondage to sin came by birth; deliverance from sin comes by death -- and it is just this way of escape that God has provided. Death is the secret of emancipation. "We...died to sin" (Romans 6:2).   

 But how can we die? Some of us have tried very hard to get rid of this sinful life, but we have found it most tenacious. What is the way out? It is not by trying to kill ourselves, but by recognizing that *God has dealt with us in Christ*. This is summed up in the apostle's next statement: "All we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death" (Romans 6:3).   

 But if God has dealt with us 'in Christ Jesus' then we have got to be in Him for this to become effective, and that now seems just as big a problem. How are we to 'get into' Christ? Here again God comes to our help. We have in fact no way of getting in, but, what is more important, we need not try to get in, for we are in. What we could not do for ourselves God has done for us. He has put us into Christ. Let me remind you of I Corinthians 1:30. I think that is one of the best verses of the whole New Testament: 'Ye are in Christ'. How? "Of him (that is, 'of God') are ye in Christ." Praise God! it is not left to us either to devise a way of entry or to work it out. We need not plan how to get in. God has planned it; and He has not only planned it but He has also performed it. 'Of him are ye in Christ Jesus'. We are in; therefore we need not try to get in. It is a Divine act, and it is accomplished.   

 Now if this is true, certain things follow. In the illustration from Hebrews 7 which we considered above we saw that *<font color ="blue">'in Abraham' all Israel</font>* -- and therefore Levi who was not yet born -- offered tithes to Melchizedek. They did not offer separately and individually, but they were in Abraham when he offered, and *<font color ="blue">his offering included all his seed</font>*. This, then, is a true figure of ourselves as 'in Christ'. When the Lord Jesus was on the Cross all of us died -- not individually, for we had not yet been born -- but, being in Him, we died in Him. "One died for all, therefore all died" (2 Cor. 5:14). When He was crucified all of us were crucified.   

 Many a time when preaching in the villages of China one has to use very simple illustrations for deep Divine truth. I remember once I took up a small book and put a piece of paper into it, and I said to those very simple ones, 'Now look carefully. I take a piece of paper. It has an identity of its own, quite separate from this book. Having no special purpose for it at the moment I put it into the book. Now I do something with the book. I post it to Shanghai. I do not post the paper, but the paper has been put into the book. Then where is the paper? Can the book go to Shanghai and the paper remain here? Can the paper have a separate destiny from the book? No! Where the book goes the paper goes. If I drop the book in the river the paper goes too, and if I quickly take it out again I recover the paper also. Whatever experience the book goes through the paper goes through with it, for it is in the book.'   

 "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus." The Lord God Himself has put us in Christ, and in His dealing with Christ God has dealt with the whole race. Our destiny is bound up with His. What He has gone through we have gone through, for to be 'in Christ' is to have been identified with Him in both His death and resurrection. He was crucified: then what about us? Must we ask God to crucify us? Never! When Christ was crucified we were crucified; and His crucifixion is past, therefore ours cannot be future. I challenge you to find one text in the New Testament telling us that our crucifixion is in the future. All the references to it are in the Greek aorist, which is the 'once-for-all' tense, the 'eternally past' tense. (See: Romans 6:6; Galations 2:20; 5:24; 6:14). And just as no man could ever commit suicide by crucifixion, for it were a physical impossibility to do so, so also, in spiritual terms, God does not require us to crucify ourselves. We were crucified when He was crucified, for God put us there in Him. That we have died in Christ is not merely a doctrinal position, it is an eternal fact.   

## His Death and Resurrection Representative and Inclusive   

 The Lord Jesus, when He died on the Cross, shed His Blood, thus giving His sinless life to atone for our sin and to satisfy the righteousness and holiness of God. To do so was the prerogative of the Son of God alone. No man could have a share in that. The Scripture has never told us that we shed our blood with Christ. In His atoning work before God He acted alone; no other could have a part. But the Lord did not die only to shed His Blood: He died that we might die. He died as our Representative. In His death He included you and me.  

 We often use the terms 'substitution' and 'identification' to describe these two aspects of the death of Christ. Now many a time the use of the word 'identification' is good. But identification would suggest that the thing begins from our side: that I try to identify myself with the Lord. I agree that the word is true, but it should be used later on. It is better to begin with the fact that the Lord included me in His death. It is the 'inclusive' death of the Lord which puts me in a position to identify myself, not that I identify myself in order to be included. It is God's inclusion of me in Christ that matters. It is something God has done. For that reason those two New Testament words "in Christ" are always very dear to my heart.   

 The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is alike inclusive. We have looked at the first chapter of I Corinthians to establish the fact that we are "in Christ Jesus". Now we will go to the end of the same letter to see something more of what this means. In I Corinthians 15:45,47 two remarkable names or titles are used of the Lord Jesus. He is spoken of there as "the last Adam" and He is spoken of too as "the second man". Scripture does not refer to Him as the second Adam but as "the last Adam"; nor does it refer to Him as the last Man, but as "the second Man". The distinction is to be noted, for it enshrines a truth of great value.   

 As the last Adam, Christ is the sum total of humanity; as the second Man, He is the Head of a new race. So we have here two unions, the one relating to His death and the other to His resurrection. In the first place His union with the race as "the last Adam" began historically at Bethlehem and ended at the cross and the tomb. In it He gathered up into Himself all that was in Adam and took it to judgment and death. In the second place our union with Him as "the second Man" begins in resurrection and ends in eternity -- which is to say, it never ends -- for, having in His death done away with the first man in whom God's purpose was frustrated, He rose again as Head of a new race of men, in whom that purpose shall be fully realized.   

 When therefore the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified as the last Adam. All that was in the first Adam was gathered up and done away in Him. We were included there. As the last Adam He wiped out the old race; as the second Man He brings in the new race. It is in His resurrection that He stands forth as the second Man, and there too we are included. "For if we have become united with him by the likeness of his death, we shall be also by the likeness of his resurrection" (Romans 6:5). We died in Him as the last Adam; we live in Him as the second Man. The Cross is thus the power of God which translates us from Adam to Christ.

<div id="chinese" class="tabcontent">
我们已经看过，罗马书一至八章分为两部分，第一部分说到血对付我们所作的，第二部分说到十字架对付我们所是的。我们需要血来赦免，我们也需要十字架来拯救。我们在前面已经简略的说过了第一部分，现在我们要来看第二部分。不过在我们说到第二部分之前，我们要再提起这几章圣经中的几个特点，这些特点加重的给我们看见，这两部分在主题上与讲论上的不同。  

### 进一步的区别

罗马书第四章和第六章分别提到复活的两方面。四章二十五节把主耶稣的复活与我们的称义连在一起。使徒说：「耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯，复活是为叫我们称义。」这里乃是说到我们在神面前的地位。而六章四节乃是说到复活将新的生命分给我们，使我们能过圣洁的生活。他说：「……原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督……从死里复活一样。」这里所说的乃是行为。  

在这两部分里面，第五章和第八章又分别说到平安。五章说到与神相安（中文圣经译成相和）是信靠他的血而得称义的结果。使徒说：「我们既因信称义，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督，得与神相和。」（五1）这是说我的罪既得了赦免，我就不再因着神而惧怕和不安了。从前与神为仇，现在已经藉着他儿子的死得与神和好（五10）。可是，我很快又发觉，我就是使我得麻烦的一个大原因。我里面仍然不安，因为在我里面，有一个东西拉我去犯罪。我与神相安了，可是与我自己却不相安；在我的心中事实上还有内战。这光景，罗马书七章说得很清楚，我们在那里看见，在我们的里面，肉体与灵有致命的冲突。但是从这里却引进了第八章所说的，在灵里行走而有的深处的平安。「体贴肉体的就是死」，因为「体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇」，「体贴圣灵的乃是生命平安」（罗八6-7）。  

我们再往下看，就会发觉这段落的头一部分，大致是对付称义的问题（例如三24-26，四5、25）。而第二部分主要所论到的，乃是相接的成圣问题（六19、22）当我们知道了因信称义这宝贵的真理，我们所知道的仍然不过是故事的一半。我们所解决的只不过是在神面前的地位。当我们继续向前去，神还有更多的东西要给我们，就如我们行为问题的解决。这几章圣经里面思想的发展，就是要强调这一点。在一件事情上，第二步总是从第一步来的；如果我们只知道第一步，那么，我们仍然将过一种在正常以下的基督徒生活。然而我们怎样才能过一种正常的基督徒生活呢？我们是怎样进入的呢？当然，首先我们必须得着罪的赦免，必须得着称义，必须与神相安；这些是我们不可少的基础。但是，即使我们有了因信基督而建立的基础，照着上面所说的，明显的我们还必须再往前去。  

所以我们看见，血是在客观方面对付我们的罪行。主耶稣作为我们的代替，已经为我们死在十字架上，担当了我们的罪，所以就为我们取得了赦免、称义与和好。现在我们必须再进一步在神的计划里，明白他如何对付我们里面的罪性。血能够洗净我的众罪，但是血不能洗净我这个「旧人」。我这个旧人需要十字架来钉死。血对付罪行，而十字架对付罪人。  

在罗马书头四章里面，你很难找到「罪人」这一个词。因为在那几章里面，主题并不是罪人，主题乃是他所犯的罪。「罪人」这一个词，到了第五章才开始显著。我们注意那里怎样开始说到罪人，这是很重要的。在第五章里面，罪人之所以称为罪人，并不是因为他犯了罪，乃是因为他生而为罪人。这个区别是很重要的。传福音的人常常喜欢用罗马书三章二十三节，「世人都犯了罪」，来说服人，使人知道他是一个罪人；但是严格说，引用这一节圣经来证明人是罪人，并不合理，如此引用这一节圣经，有颠倒始末的危险。因为罗马书的教训并不是说，由於我们犯了罪，所以我们是罪人；相反的，罗马书是说，由於我们是罪人，所以我们犯罪。我们生来就是罪人，并不是因为犯了罪才成为罪人。正如五章十九节所说的：「因一人的悖逆，众人成为（构成）罪人。」  

我们是怎样成为罪人的呢？由於亚当的悖逆。我们成为罪人，并不是由於我们所作的，乃是因为亚当所作并所成的。这就如我现在说英语，但是我并不因此而成为一个英国人，事实上我却是一个中国人。所以第三章引我们注意我们所作的──「都犯了罪」。但是要记得，我们之所以成为罪人，并非因为我们所作的。  

有一次我问一班小孩子，「甚么样的人是罪人？」他们立刻回答说：「犯罪的人是罪人。」是的，犯罪的人就是罪人，但是犯罪不过是一个证据，证明他已经是一个罪人；那并不是原因。不错，**<font color ="blue">一个犯罪的人是一个罪人；但是一个没有犯罪的人，如果他是亚当的族类，他仍是一个罪人</font>**，也需要救赎。你们明白我所说的吗？有的人是坏罪人，也有的人是好罪人；有的人是有道德的罪人，也有的人是败坏的罪人；然而他们都是罪人。有时我们想，只要我不作某些事，一切就都好了。那知难处远深过我们的 **<font color ="blue">所作所为</font>**，我们的难处乃在於我们的 **<font color ="blue">所是</font>**。一个中国人可以生在美国，并且一句中国话也不会说，但是他还是一个中国人，因为他生而为中国人。我们是怎样生的，就是怎样的人。我之所以是罪人，因为我是从亚当生的。**<font color ="blue">我之成为一个罪人，并不是由於我的行为，乃是由於血统和遗传</font>**。并不是因为我犯了罪，所以我是一个罪人；相反的，因为我是出之於罪恶的种族，所以我犯罪。我所以犯罪，因为我是一个罪人。  

我们很容易这样想，我们所作的虽然很坏，可是我们自己并没有这么坏。神却再三的要我们看见，我们是邪恶的，我们的根本是邪恶的。我们一切难处的根，就在於我们是罪人，而罪人必须被对付。对付我们罪行的是主的血，对付我们自己的乃是主的十字架。血为我们从我们所作的获得赦免；十字架使我们从我们的所是得着释放。  

### 人类的天性

我们因此来到了罗马书五章十二节至二十一节。在这几节圣经里面，我们看见恩典与罪恶对比，基督的顺服与亚当的悖逆对抗。罗马书第二部分（五12至八39）的开始就说这一点，我们现在特别注意这几节。那里的议论引到一个结论，这一个结论是我们进一步默想的基础。那个结论是甚么呢？五章十九节说：「因一人的悖逆，众人成为罪人，照样，因一人的顺从，众人也成为义了。」神的灵在这里首先要给我们看见的是，我们是怎样的人，然後再给我们看见，我们是怎样成为这样的人。  

当我们基督徒生活开始的时候，我们所关心的只是我们的行为，还没有注意到我们为人的本质；我们的忧愁常常是为着我们的所作和所行，很少是为着我们的这个人。我们以为，只要我们能在某些事上加以改正，我们就是好的基督徒，因此我们就着手 **<font color ="blue">改变我们的行动</font>**。但是结果并不如我们所想像的。使我们沮丧的是我们渐渐的发现，我们的难处不只是外面的行为；事实上，我们里面的难处却更严重。我们试着要讨神喜悦，但是发觉在我们里面却有些东西不愿讨他喜悦。我们试着想谦卑，可是我们里面却有些东西拒绝谦卑。我们试着要爱，而我们里面感觉到非常不愿意爱。我们在外面微笑着设法显出温柔，而我们里面却明确的感觉到不温柔。当我们越要在外面把事情加以改正，我们就越清楚，在我们里面的难处，是何等的根深蒂固。到这时我们就来到主面前向他说：「主阿，我现在明白了！不只我所作的是错；连 **<font color ="blue">我这个人也是错的</font>**。」  

罗马书五章十九节的结论，这时开始向我们有了一点亮光。我们是罪人，在性情上是属於神所不要的一种族类。堕落使亚当在他的性格上有了基本的改变，他就因此成为一个根本不能讨神喜悦的罪人。我们不仅在外表上，具有这族类的相同点，连我们里面的性格也不例外。我们「生来就是罪人」。怎样会这样的呢？保罗说：「因一人的悖逆。」我要试着来解释这一点。  

我姓倪，这是中国一个很普通的姓。我怎样有这个姓的呢？这并不是我选择的。并不是我先查了中国的姓氏表，然後选择了这个姓。事实上我姓倪的这件事，完全不是出於我的，并且我也不能作甚么以改变我的姓。我所以姓倪是因为我父亲姓倪，我父亲姓倪是因为我祖父姓倪。如果我的所作所为，像一个姓倪的，我固然姓倪；就是我的所作所为不像一个姓倪的，我仍然姓倪。无论我贵为中国的总统，或卑为街上的一个乞丐，我仍然姓倪。我或作甚么或不作甚么，都不会改变我姓倪的这个事实。  

我们是罪人，这不是由於我们自己使然的，乃是因为亚当。并不是因为我个人犯了罪，所以我成了罪人，乃是因为亚当犯罪的时候，我已经在他里面。因为我是从亚当生的，所以我是他的一部分。我不能改变这件事，我不能藉着改善我的行为，就使我置身亚当之外，而不再是一个罪人。  

当我在中国的时候，我有一次说到我们在亚当里已经犯了罪，有一个人说他不明白，我就试着这样向他解释。我说：「所有的中国人都承认，黄帝是他们的始祖。四千多年前，他与蚩尤作战。虽然敌人很凶猛，但黄帝却战胜了他，并且杀了他。此後黄帝就建立了中华民族。因此我们的民族建立於四千多年前，是黄帝所建立的。设若黄帝未能杀死他的敌人，反为敌人所杀，试想现在的情形将是怎样呢？你现在又在那里呢？」他回答说：「根本就没有我。」我说：「哦，不！黄帝死他的，你可以活你的。」他喊着说：「这是不可能的！如果他被蚩尤所杀，那就绝对不会有我，因为我是出於他的。」  

在此你是否看见人类生命的一贯性？我们的生命来自亚当。如果你的曾祖父三岁就死了，你在那里呢？你自然也在他里面死了！你的经历是系在他的经历上的。同样我们一个人的经历，与亚当的经历也是不可分的。无人能说，我从未在伊甸园，因为从潜在的事实来说，当亚当听从蛇引诱的时候，我们都在那里。因此我们都牵涉在亚当的罪里，并且因为我们是在亚当里生的，我们就从他接受了一切由於犯罪而产生的後果──亚当的性情，换一句话说，就是罪人的性情。我们的存在是由於他，而他的生命和性情，既成为有罪的，因此我们从他得来的性情也是有罪的。所以正如我们所说过的，我们的难处乃是在我们的遗传，并不在我们的行为。除非我们能改变我们的血统，我们就别无拯救。  

就在这一个方向，我们会找到问题的解决，因为神正是这样的对付了这个情势。  

### 在亚当里与在基督里

罗马书五章十二节至二十一节，不仅告诉我们亚当的事，也告诉我们主耶稣的事。「因一人的悖逆，众人成为罪人，照样，因一人的顺从，众人也成为义了。」在亚当里我们接受一切属於亚当的；照样，在基督里我们接受一切属於基督的。  

在亚当里与在基督里这两个名词，基督徒领会得太少了！我不怕重复，我要用一个例证，再着重的说到在基督里的遗传与种族的重要性。这例证是在希伯来书里面的。你们记得希伯来书的作者，在这封书信的前面，设法说出麦基洗德比利未更大。他所要证明的一点就是，基督为大祭司的职任，比出於利未支派的大祭司亚伦更大。为着要证明这一点，他首先必须证明，麦基洗德的祭司职位，比利未的祭司职位更大。他这样作的理由很简单，因为基督的祭司职位，是照着麦基洗德的等次（来七14-17），而亚伦的祭司职位，自然是照着利未的等次。如果他能给我们看见麦基洗德比利末大，他就说明了他所要说的一点。希伯来书的作者用一个卓越的方法，证明了这一点。  

他在希伯来书第七章里面告诉我们，亚伯拉罕杀败诸王回来的时候（创十四），将掳物的十分之一献给麦基洗德，并且从他那里接受了祝福。亚伯拉罕既这样作，利未就没有麦基洗德这么大了。这是为甚么呢？因为亚伯拉罕献十分之一给麦基洗德的时候，在亚伯拉罕里面的以撒也献了十分之一。同样，在亚伯拉罕里的雅各，也给麦基洗德献了十分之一。那么，在亚伯拉罕里面的利未，也献了十分之一给麦基洗德。这是很显然的，位分小的向位分大的奉献（来七7）。因此利未的位分比麦基洗德小，亚伦的祭司职位比主耶稣的祭司职位低。在列王争战的时候，利未尚未生出来，但是他却在他先祖亚伯拉罕的身中，并且可说，藉着亚伯拉罕纳了十分之一（来七9-10）。  

这就是在基督里的意义。亚伯拉罕是信心之家的父，全家都包括在他里面。当他向麦基洗德献上十分之一的时候，全家也都在他里面献上了十分之一。他们不是个别献上的；因为他们是在亚伯拉罕的里面，所以当亚伯拉罕奉献的时候，就在他的奉献上也包括了他的後裔。  

在此我们看见了一个新的可能性。在亚当里一切都丧失了。因着一个人的悖逆，我们都成为罪人。罪既是藉着他进入人类，死又是因罪而来，於是从那一天起，罪就作了王叫人死。然而在此却有希望之光照入。因着另一个人的顺从，使我们可以成为义。罪在那里显多，恩典就更显多了。罪如何作王叫人死，照样恩典也藉着义作王，叫人因我们的主耶稣基督得着永远的生命（罗五19-21）。我们的绝望是在亚当里，我们的希望乃是在基督里。

### 神拯救的方法

很清楚的，神是愿意藉着这个方法，引我们实际的经历从罪中得着释放。在第六章的一开始，保罗就这样问：「我们可以仍在罪中，叫恩典显多么？」他的全人在这问话中惊退，大声说：「断乎不可！」一位圣洁的神，怎能满意他儿女们的不圣洁和被罪捆绑？因此他又说：「我们在罪上死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢？」（罗六2）感谢神，他为我们作了适当的预备，使我们不受罪的辖制。

但是这里有一个问题：我们生来就是罪人，怎能切断有罪的遗传呢？我们是在亚当里生的，我们怎能从亚当里出来呢？我要确定的说，主的血不能把我们从亚当里迁出来。只有一个方法。我们既是藉着生进入的，我们惟有藉着死出来。要去掉我们的罪性，我们必须去掉我们的生命。罪的捆绑既是因生而开始，那么罪的释放惟有藉着死而引进。这正是神为我们预备的脱离罪的方法。得释放的秘诀就是死。所以圣经说：「我们在罪上死了。」（罗六2）

然而我们怎能死呢？许多人曾尽力设法要脱掉他们有罪的生命，却发觉有罪的生命牢不可去。那么蒙拯救的路在那里呢？蒙拯救的路并不在於我们杀死自己，乃在於承认神已经在基督里对付了我们。使徒保罗接着的话正好说明了这意思：「岂不知我们这受浸归入基督耶稣的人，是受浸归入他的死么？」（罗马六3）

如果神已经在基督耶稣里对付了我们，那么我们必须在他里面，拯救的方法才有功效。这样，在基督里是一个大问题了。我们怎样进入基督里呢？这件事仍然必须藉着神。事实上我们是无法进入的，并且更重要的是，我们根本用不着设法进入，因为我们就在他里面。我们所不能替自己为力的事，神已经替我们作成了。神已经把我们放在基督里。哥林多前书一章三十节的话真好，我想那是整本新约中最好经节之一。使徒说：「你们得在基督耶稣里。」是怎样得在的呢？「是本乎神。」赞美神，进入基督里的事，神没有留给我们自己去设计，去努力。我们无须自己计划如何进入，因为神已经计划了，不只计划了，并且还成全了。你们得在基督里是在乎神。*<font color ="blue">我们已经在基督里，因此我们不需要再想法进入</font>*。这是神的作为，并且已经成全了。

如果这是真的，一些事就随着而来。在我们所引希伯来书七章的例证里，我们看见所有的以色列人──连同还没有生出的利未──都在亚伯拉罕里献了十分之一给麦基洗德。他们并不是分开个别献的，乃是当亚伯拉罕奉献的时候，他们是在亚伯拉罕的里面，所以 **<font color ="blue">亚伯拉罕的奉献也包括了他所有的後裔</font>**。这正是我们在基督里的一个预表。当主耶稣在十字架上死的时候，我们都死了──不是个别去死的，因为那时我们还没有出生。因为我们在他里面，所以我们就在他里面死了。使徒说：「一人既替众人死，众人就都死了。」（林後五14）。**<font color ="blue">当他被钉在十字架上死了的时候，我们也都被钉死了</font>**。

我们在中国乡村传道，常常要用很简单的比方，来说明深奥的真理。我记得有一次我拿了一本小书，在书里夹着一张纸，我对那些乡下人说：「请你们现在注意看。我拿了一张纸，这张纸有它自己的样子，与这本书完全不同。现在这张纸对於我没有甚么特别用处，我把它放在这本书里面。我现在把这本书寄到上海去，试问这张纸结果在那里呢！能不能书到了上海，这张纸却仍留在这里？这张纸会与这本书有不同的命运吗？显然不会！虽然我只是把这本书寄去，但是因为这张纸已经被我放在书里面，所以书到了那里，这张纸也到了那里。倘若我把这本书扔在河里，纸也被扔在河里；如果我快快把书捞了起来，这纸也被捞了起来。这书所经历的一切，这纸也同样经历，因为这张纸是在这本书的里面。」

「但你们得在基督耶稣里，是本乎神。」神自己已经把我们放在基督里面，所以凡是他在基督身上所作的，也已经作在凡在基督里的全族类。我们与他是同命运的。凡他所经历过的，我们也经历过，因为我们是在基督里，这就使我们在他的死和复活上都得与共。他已经在十字架上被钉死，我们又怎样呢？难道我们必须求神也把我们钉死在十字架上吗？绝不需要！ **<font color ="blue">当基督被钉死的时候，我们也被钉死了</font>**；他的被钉死既是已过的事实，那么我们的被钉死绝 **<font color ="blue">不能是一种将来</font>** 的事。我向你们挑战，你不能在新约里找出一节圣经，说到我们的钉十字架，是将来的事。在希腊文里面，说到钉十字架所用的一个字，在时间上是永远 **<font color ="blue">过去式</font>**（参看罗六6；加二20，五24，六14）。正如从来没有人藉着钉十字架自杀，因为在身体上这是不可能的；照样，在属灵方面，这也是不可能的。神没有要我们把自己钉在十字架上。当基督被钉十字架的时候，我们也被钉了，因为神把我们放在他里面。我们已经在基督里死了，这不仅是一个教义，并且是一个永远的事实。

### 主的死与复活的代表性与包括性

主耶稣在十字架上受死，流出他的血，就以他无罪的生命为我们赎罪，满足了神的公义和圣洁。

只有神的儿子有这样作的特权，此外无人能分担救赎的工作。圣经从来没有告诉我们，我们和基督同流血，因为他是在神面前单独为我们作赎罪的工作，任何人都不能有分。但是主的受死不仅是为着流血，他死同时是为着要我们也死。他是代表着我们死，在他的死里，包括着我和你。

我们常常用替死和同死来说到主死的两方面。同死是一个很好的词，但是同死的说法，会令人误以为同死的事实，是从我们这一面开始的，是我要与主一同死。我同意这个词是对的，但是在应用上不能太早。最好先从 **<font color ="blue">主把我包括在他的死里</font>** 的事实开始。是主包罗万有的死，将我放在与他同死的地位上。并 **<font color ="blue">不是我自己去与他同死</font>**，使我被包括在他的死里面。是神将我包括在基督里，这才是重要的。这是神已经作成的事。为着这个缘故，新约里面的这几个字──在基督里──我真是感觉它们的宝贵。  

主耶稣的死是包罗万有的。主耶稣的复活也同样是包罗万有的。我们已经在哥林多前书第一章里面看见，我们是在基督耶稣里。在同一封书信的末了，我们又看见关於这事更丰富的意义。在哥林多前书十五章四十五节与四十七节中，有两个显著的名字或衔头，用来说到主耶稣。在那里主被称为末後的亚当，也被称为第二个人。圣经没有称他为第二个亚当，却称他为末後的亚当；圣经不说他是末後的人，却说他是第二个人。我们要注意这里的区别，因为里面藏着一个极重要的真理。  

作为末後的亚当，基督是人类的总体；作为第二个人，他是一个新族类的元首。所以在这里我们有两个联合，一个是关於他的死，另一个是关於他的复活。第一，他与人类联结，作了末後的亚当，在历史上是开始於伯利恒，而终结於十字架与坟墓。他把所有在亚当里面的，都归结在他自己里面，然後带到审判与死亡。第二，他是第二个人，我们与他联合，这乃是从复活开始，而终结於永远──那就是说永无终了。他的死已经除去了第一个人，因为神的目的在第一个人身上已经失败了。他从死里复活作了新族类的元首，神的目的在新族类身上将要完满的实现。  

因此当主耶稣被钉在十字架上的时候，他是以末後亚当的身分被钉死的。所有在头一个亚当里面的一切，都集中在他身上而被除去了，我们都包括在里面。他来作末後的亚当，就除去了旧的族类；他来作第二个人，就带来了新的族类。他乃是在他的复活里面作第二个人，这里面包括着我们。「我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。」（罗六5）我们在末後的亚当里面死了；我们在第二个人里面活着。因此十字架是神的一个权能，把我们从亚当里迁到基督里。
