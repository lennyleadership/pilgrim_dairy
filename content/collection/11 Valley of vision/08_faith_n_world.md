O LORD,

The world is artful to entrap,
<br>&emsp;  approaches in fascinating guise,
<br>&emsp;  extends many a gilded bait,
<br>&emsp;  presents many a charming face.
<br>Let my faith scan every painted bauble,
<br>&emsp;  and escape every bewitching snare
<br>&emsp;  in a victory that overcomes all things.
<br>In my duties give me firmness, energy, zeal,
<br>&emsp;  devotion to thy cause,
<br>&emsp;  courage in thy name,
<br>&emsp;  love as a working grace,
<br>&emsp;  and all commensurate with my trust.
<br>Let faith stride forth in giant power,
<br>&emsp;  and love respond with energy in every act.
<br>I often mourn the absence of my beloved Lord
<br>&emsp;  whose smile makes earth a paradise,
<br>&emsp;  whose voice is sweetest music,
<br>&emsp;  whose presence gives all graces strength.
<br>But by unbelief I often keep him outside my door.
<br>Let faith give entrance that he may abide with me for ever.

<br>Thy Word is full of promises,
<br>&emsp;  flowers of sweet fragrance,
<br>&emsp;  fruit of refreshing flavour
<br>&emsp;  when culled by faith.
<br>May I be made rich in its riches,
<br>&emsp;  be strong in its power,
<br>&emsp;  be happy in its joy,
<br>&emsp;  abide in its sweetness,
<br>&emsp;  feast on its preciousness,
<br>&emsp;  draw vigour from its manna.
<br>Lord, increase my faith.
