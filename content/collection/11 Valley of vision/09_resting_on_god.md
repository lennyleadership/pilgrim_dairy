O GOD MOST HIGH, MOST GLORIOUS,

The thought of thine infinite serenity cheers me,
<br>For I am toiling and moiling<label for="moil" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">toil and moil: work hard</span>, troubled and distressed,
<br>&emsp;  but thou art for ever at perfect peace.
<br>Thy designs cause thee no fear or care of unfulfilment,
<br>&emsp;  they stand fast as the eternal hills.
<br>Thy power knows no bond,
<br>&emsp;  thy goodness no stint.
<br>Thou bringest order out of confusion,
<br>&emsp;  and my defeats are thy victories:
<br>The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
<br>I come to thee as a sinner with cares and sorrows,
<br>&emsp;  to leave every concern entirely to thee,
<br>&emsp;  every sin calling for Christâ€™s precious blood;
<br>Revive deep spirituality in my heart;
<br>Let me live near to the great Shepherd,
<br>&emsp;  hear his voice, know its tones, follow its calls.
<br>Keep me from deception by causing me to abide in the truth</b>,
<br>&emsp;  from harm by <b>helping me to walk in the power of the Spirit</b>.
<br>Give me intenser faith in the eternal verities,
<br>&emsp;  burning into me by experience the things I know;
<br>Let me never be ashamed of the truth of the gospel,
<br>&emsp;  that I may bear its reproach,
<br>&emsp;  vindicate it,
<br>&emsp;  see Jesus as its essence,
<br>&emsp;  know in it the power of the Spirit.
<br>Lord, help me, for I am often lukewarm and chill;
<br>&emsp;  unbelief mars my confidence,
<br>&emsp;  sin makes me forget thee.
<br>Let the weeds that grow in my soul be cut at their roots;
<br>Grant me to know that I truly live only when I live to thee,
<br>&emsp;  that all else is trifling.
<br>Thy presence alone can make me holy, devout, strong and happy.
<br>Abide in me, gracious God.
