HEAVENLY FATHER

Thou hast revealed to me myself
<br>&emsp;      as a mass of sin,
<br>&emsp;  and thyself as the fullness of goodness,
<br>&emsp;    with strength enough to succour me,
<br>&emsp;    wisdom enough to guide me,
<br>&emsp;    mercy enough to quicken me,
<br>&emsp;    love enough to satisfy me.
<br>Thou hast shown me that because thou art mine
<br>&emsp;    I can live by thy life,
<br>&emsp;    be strong in thy strength,
<br>&emsp;    be guided by thy wisdom;
<br>&emsp;  and so I can pitch my thoughts and heart in thee.

<br>This is the exchange of wonderful love â€”
<br>&emsp;  for me to have thee for myself,
<br>&emsp;  and for thee to have me, and to give me thyself.
<br>There is in thee all fullness of the good I need,
<br>&emsp;  and the fullness of all grace to draw me to thyself,
<br>&emsp;  who, else, could never have come.
<br>But having come, I must cleave to thee,
<br>&emsp;  be knit to thee,
<br>&emsp;  always seek thee.
<br>There is none all good as thou art:
<br>With thee I can live without other things,
<br>&emsp;  for thou art God all-sufficient,
<br>&emsp;  and the glory, peace, rest, joy of the world
<br>&emsp;    is a creaturely, perishing thing
<br>&emsp;      in comparison with thee.

<br>Help me to know that he who hopes for nothing
<br>&emsp;    but thee,
<br>&emsp;  and for all things only for thee, hopes truly,
<br>&emsp;  and that I must place all my happiness in holiness,
<br>&emsp;    if I hope to be filled with all grace.
<br>Convince me that I can have no peace at death,
<br>&emsp;  nor hope that I should go to Christ,
<br>&emsp;    unless I intend to do his will
<br>&emsp;  and have his fullness while I live.
