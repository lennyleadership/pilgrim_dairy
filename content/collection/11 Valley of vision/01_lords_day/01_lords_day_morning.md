O MAKER AND UPHOLDER OF ALL THINGS,

Day and night are thine; 
<br>&emsp;    they are also mine from thee â€”
<br>&emsp;  the night to rid me of the cares of the day,
<br>&emsp;    to refresh my weary body,
<br>&emsp;    to renew my natural strength;
<br>&emsp;  the day to summon me to new activities,
<br>&emsp;    to give me opportunity to glorify thee,
<br>&emsp;    to serve my generation,
<br>&emsp;    to acquire knowledge, holiness, eternal life.
<br>But one day above all days is made especially
<br>&emsp;  for thy honour and my improvement;
The sabbath reminds me
<br>&emsp;  of thy rest from creation,
<br>&emsp;  of the resurrection of my Saviour,
<br>&emsp;  of his entering into repose.
<br>Thy house is mine,
<br>&emsp;  but I am unworthy to meet thee there,
<br>&emsp;    and am unfit for spiritual service.
<br>When I enter it I come before thee as a sinner,
<br>&emsp;  condemned by conscience and thy Word,
For I am still in the body and in the wilderness,
<br>&emsp;  ignorant, weak, in danger,
<br>&emsp;  and in need of thine aid.
<br>But encouraged by thy all-sufficient grace
<br>&emsp;  let me go to thy house with a lively hope
<br>&emsp;    of meeting thee,
<br>&emsp;  knowing that there thou wilt come to me
<br>&emsp;    and give me peace.
My soul is drawn out to thee in longing desires
<br>&emsp;  for thy presence in the sanctuary, at the table,
<br>&emsp;  where all are entertained on a feast of
<br>&emsp;    good things;
Let me before the broken elements,
<br>&emsp;    emblems of thy dying love,
<br>&emsp;  cry to thee with broken heart for grace
<br>&emsp;    and forgiveness.
<br>I long for that blissful communion of thy people
<br>&emsp;  in thy eternal house in the perfect kingdom;
<br>These are they that follow the Lamb;
<br>May I be of their company!
