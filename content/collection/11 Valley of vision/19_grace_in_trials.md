FATHER OF MERCIES,

Hear me for Jesus’ sake.
<br>&emsp;      I am sinful even in my closest walk with thee;
<br>&emsp;  it is of thy mercy I died not long ago;
<br>Thy grace has given me faith in the cross
<br>&emsp;  by which thou hast reconciled thyself to me
<br>&emsp;    and me to thee,
<br>&emsp;  drawing me by thy great love,
<br>&emsp;  reckoning me as innocent in Christ though
<br>&emsp;    guilty in myself.

<br>Giver of all graces,
<br>I look to thee for strength to maintain them in me,
<br>&emsp;  for it is hard to practise what I believe.
<br>Strengthen me against temptations.
<br>My heart is an unexhausted fountain of sin,
<br>&emsp;  a river of corruption since childhood days,
<br>&emsp;  flowing on in every pattern of behaviour;
<br>Thou hast disarmed me of the means in which I trusted,
<br>&emsp;  and I have no strength but in thee.
<br>Thou alone canst hold back my evil ways,
<br>&emsp;  but without thy grace to sustain me I fall.
<br>Satan’s darts quickly inflame me,
<br>&emsp;  and the shield that should quench them
<br>&emsp;    easily drops from my hand:
<br>Empower me against his wiles and assaults.
<br>Keep me sensible of my weakness,
<br>&emsp;  and of my dependence upon thy strength.

<br>Let every trial teach me more of thy peace,
<br>&emsp;  more of thy love.
<br>Thy Holy Spirit is given to increase thy graces,
<br>&emsp;  and I cannot preserve or improve them
<br>&emsp;    unless he works continually in me.
<br>May he confirm my trust in thy promised help,
<br>&emsp;  and let me walk humbly in dependence upon thee,
<br>&emsp;  for Jesus’ sake.
