O CHRIST,

All thy ways of mercy tend to and end in my delight.
<br>Thou didst weep, sorrow, suffer that I might rejoice.
<br>For my joy thou hast sent the Comforter,
<br>&emsp;  multiplied thy promises,
<br>&emsp;  shown me my future happiness,
<br>&emsp;  given me a living fountain.
<br>Thou art preparing joy for me and me for joy;
<br>I pray for joy, wait for joy, long for joy;
<br>&emsp;  give me more than I can hold, desire, or think of.
<br>Measure out to me my times and degrees of joy,
<br>&emsp;  at my work, business, duties.
<br>If I weep at night, give me joy in the morning.

<br>Let me rest in the thought of thy love,
<br>&emsp;  pardon for sin, my title to heaven,
<br>&emsp;  my future unspotted state.
<br>I am an unworthy recipient of thy grace.
<br>I often disesteem thy blood and slight thy love,
<br>&emsp;  but can in repentance draw water
<br>&emsp;  from the wells of thy joyous forgiveness.

<br>Let my heart leap towards <b>the eternal sabbath</b>,
<br>&emsp;  where the work of redemption, sanctiﬁcation,
<br>&emsp;    preservation, gloriﬁcation is ﬁnished
<br>&emsp;    and perfected for ever,
<br>&emsp;  where thou wilt rejoice over me with joy.
<br>There is no joy like the joy of heaven,<label for="joy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The meaning of joy</span>
<br>&emsp;  for in that state are no sad divisions,
<br>&emsp;  unchristian quarrels,
<br>&emsp;  contentions, evil designs,
<br>&emsp;  weariness, hunger, cold,
<br>&emsp;  sadness, sin, suffering,
<br>&emsp;  persecutions, toils of duty.
<br>O healthful place where none are sick!
<br>O happy land where all are kings!
<br>O holy assembly where all are priests!
<br>How free a state where none are servants
<br>&emsp;  except to thee!
<br>Bring me speedily to the land of joy.
