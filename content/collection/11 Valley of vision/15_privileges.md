O LORD GOD,

Teach me to know that grace precedes,
<br>&emsp;  accompanies, and follows my salvation,
<br>&emsp;  that it sustains the redeemed soul,
<br>&emsp;  that not one link of its chain can ever break.
<br><b>From Calvaryâ€™s cross wave upon wave of grace
<br>&emsp;  reaches me,
<br>&emsp;  deals with my sin,
<br>&emsp;  washes me clean,
<br>&emsp;  renews my heart,
<br>&emsp;  strengthens my will,
<br>&emsp;  draws out my affection,
<br>&emsp;  kindles a flame in my soul,
<br>&emsp;  rules throughout my inner man,
<br>&emsp;  consecrates my every thought, word, work,
<br>&emsp;  teaches me thy immeasurable love.</b>
<br>How great are my privileges in Christ Jesus!
<br>Without him I stand far off, a stranger, an outcast;
<br>&emsp;  in him I draw near and touch his kingly sceptre.
<br>Without him I dare not lift up my guilty eyes;
<br>&emsp;  in him I gaze upon my Father-God and Friend.
<br>Without him I hide my lips in trembling shame;
<br>&emsp;  in him I open my mouth in petition and praise.
<br>Without him all is wrath and consuming fire;
<br>&emsp;  in him is all love, and the repose of my soul.
<br>Without him is gaping hell below me, and eternal anguish;
<br>&emsp;  in him its gates are barred to me by his precious blood.
<br>Without him darkness spreads its horrors in front;
<br>&emsp;  in him an eternity of glory is my boundless horizon.
<br>Without him all within me is terror and dismay,
<br>&emsp;  in him every accusation is charmed into joy and peace.
<br>Without him all things external call for my condemnation;
<br>&emsp;  in him they minister to my comfort,
<br>&emsp;  and are to be enjoyed with thanksgiving.
<br>Praise be to thee for grace,
<br>&emsp;  and for the unspeakable gift of Jesus.
