REMEMBER, O MY SOUL,

It is thy duty and privilege to rejoice in God:
<br>He requires it of thee for all his favours of grace.
<br>Rejoice then in the Giver and his goodness,
<br>Be happy in him, O my heart, and 
<br>&emsp;  in nothing but God,
<br>&emsp;  for whatever a man trusts in,
<br>&emsp;  from that he expects happiness.

<br>He who is the ground of thy faith
<br>&emsp;  should be the substance of thy joy.
<br>Whence then comes heaviness and dejection,
<br>&emsp;  when joy is sown in thee,
<br>&emsp;    promised by the Father,
<br>&emsp;    bestowed by the Son,
<br>&emsp;    inwrought by the Holy Spirit,
<br>&emsp;    thine by grace,
<br>&emsp;    thy birthright in believing?

<br>Art thou seeking to rejoice in thyself
<br>&emsp;  from an evil motive of pride and self-reputation?
<br>Thou hast nothing of thine own but sin,
<br>&emsp;  nothing to move God to be gracious
<br>&emsp;  or to continue his grace towards thee.
<br>If thou forget this thou wilt lose thy joy.
<br>Art thou grieving under a sense of indwelling sin?
<br>Let godly sorrow work repentance,
<br>&emsp;  as the true spirit which the Lord blesses,
<br>&emsp;  and which creates fullest joy;
<br>Sorrow for self opens rejoicing in God,
<br>Self-loathing draws down divine delights.
<br>Hast thou sought joys in some creature comfort?
<br>Look not below God for happiness;
<br>&emsp;  fall not asleep in Delilahâ€™s lap.
<br>Let God be all in all to thee,
<br>&emsp;  and joy in the fountain that is always full.
