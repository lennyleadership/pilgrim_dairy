GLORIOUS GOD,

It is the flame of my life to worship thee,
<br>&emsp;    the crown and glory of my soul to adore thee,
<br>&emsp;    heavenly pleasure to approach thee.
<br>Give me power by thy Spirit to help me worship now,
<br>&emsp;  that I may forget the world,
<br>&emsp;    be brought into fullness of life,
<br>&emsp;    be refreshed, comforted, blessed.
<br>Give me knowledge of thy goodness
<br>&emsp;  that I might not be over-awed by thy greatness;
Give me Jesus, Son of Man, Son of God,
<br>&emsp;  that I might not be terrified,
<br>&emsp;    but be drawn near with filial love,
<br>&emsp;     with holy boldness;
<br>He is my Mediator, Brother, Interpreter,
<br>Branch, Daysman, Lamb;
<br>&emsp;    him I glorify,
<br>&emsp;    in him I am set on high.
<br>Crowns to give I have none,
<br>&emsp;  but what thou hast given I return,
<br>&emsp;  content to feel that everything is mine
<br>&emsp;    when it is thine,
<br>&emsp;  and the more fully mine when I have yielded it
<br>&emsp;    to thee.
<br>Let me live wholly to my Saviour,
<br>&emsp;  free from distractions,
<br>&emsp;    from carking care,
<br>&emsp;    from hindrances to the pursuit
<br>&emsp;      of the narrow way.
<br>I am pardoned through the blood of Jesus â€”
<br>&emsp;  give me a new sense of it,
<br>&emsp;  continue to pardon me by it,
<br>&emsp;  may I come every day to the fountain,
<br>&emsp;  and every day be washed anew,
<br>&emsp;  that I may worship thee always
<br>&emsp;    in spirit and truth.
