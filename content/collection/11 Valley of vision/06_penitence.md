O LORD OF GRACE,

I have been hasty and short in private prayer,
<br>&emsp;    O quicken my conscience to feel this folly,
<br>&emsp;    to bewail this ingratitude;
My first sin of the day leads into others,
<br>&emsp;  and it is just that thou shouldst withdraw thy presence
<br>&emsp;  from one who waited carelessly on thee.
<br>Keep me at all times from robbing thee,
<br>&emsp;  and from depriving my soul of thy due worship;
<br>Let me never forget
<br>&emsp;  that I have an eternal duty to love, honour and obey thee,
<br>&emsp;  that thou art infinitely worthy of such;
<br>&emsp;  that if I fail to glorify thee
<br>I am guilty of infinite evil that merits infinite punishment,
<br>&emsp;    for sin is the violation of an infinite obligation.

O forgive me if I have dishonoured thee,
<br>Melt my heart, heal my backslidings,
<br>&emsp;  and open an intercourse of love.
<br>When the fire of thy compassion warms my inward man,
<br>&emsp;  and the outpourings of thy Spirit fill my soul,
<br>&emsp;    then I feelingly wonder at my own depravity, and deeply abhor myself;
<br>&emsp;    then thy grace is a powerful incentive to repentance,
<br>&emsp;    and an irresistible motive to inward holiness.
<br>May I never forget that thou hast my heart in thy hands.
<br>Apply to it the merits of Christ’s atoning blood whenever I sin.
<br>Let thy mercies draw me to thyself.
<br>Wean me from all evil, mortify me to the world,
<br>&emsp;  and make me ready for my departure hence
<br>&emsp;  animated by the humiliations of penitential love.
<br>My soul is often a chariot without wheels,
<br>&emsp;  clogged and hindered in sin’s miry clay;
<br>Mount it on eagle’s wings
<br>&emsp;  and cause it to soar upward to thyself.
