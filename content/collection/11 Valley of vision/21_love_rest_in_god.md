MY DEAR LORD

I depend wholly upon thee,
<br>&emsp;    wean me from all other dependences.
Thou art my all, thou dost overrule all
<br>&emsp;    and delight in me.
Thou art the foundation of goodness,
<br>&emsp;  how can I distrust thee?
<br>&emsp;  how be anxious about what happens to me?
In the light of thy preciousness
<br>&emsp;  the world and all its enjoyments are infinitely poor:
I value the favour of men no more than pebbles.
Amid the blessings I receive from thee
<br>&emsp;    may I never lose the heart of a stranger.
May I love thee, my Benefactor, in all my benefits,
<br>&emsp;  not forgetting that my greatest danger
<br>&emsp;    arises from my advantages.
Produce in me self-despair that will
<br>&emsp;  make Jesus precious to me,
<br>&emsp;    delightful in all his offices,
<br>&emsp;    pleasurable in all his ways,
<br>&emsp;  and may I love his commands
<br>&emsp;    as well as his promises.
Help me to discern between true and false love,
<br>&emsp;  the one consisting of supreme love to thee,
<br>&emsp;    the other not,
<br>&emsp;  the former uniting thy glory and manâ€™s happiness
<br>&emsp;    that they may become one common interest,
<br>&emsp;  the latter disjointing and separating them both,
<br>&emsp;    seeking the latter with neglect of the former.
Teach me that genuine love is different in kind
<br>&emsp;  from that wrought by rational arguments
<br>&emsp;    or the motive of self-interest,
<br>&emsp;  that such love is a pleasing passion affording
<br>&emsp;    joy to the mind where it is.
Grant me grace to distinguish
<br>&emsp;    between the genuine and the false,
 <br>&emsp;     and to rest in thee who art all love.
