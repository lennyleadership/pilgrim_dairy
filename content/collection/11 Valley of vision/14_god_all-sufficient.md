O LORD OF GRACE,

The world is before me this day,
<br>&emsp;  and I am weak and fearful,
<br>&emsp;  but I look to thee for strength;
<br>If I venture forth alone I stumble and fall,
<br>&emsp;  but on the Belovedâ€™s arms I am firm
<br>&emsp;  as the eternal hills;
<br>If left to the treachery of my heart
<br>&emsp;  I shall shame thy Name,
<br>&emsp;  but if enlightened, guided, upheld by thy Spirit,
<br>&emsp;  I shall bring thee glory.
<br>Be thou my arm to support,
<br>&emsp;  my strength to stand,
<br>&emsp;  my light to see,
<br>&emsp;  my feet to run,
<br>&emsp;  my shield to protect,
<br>&emsp;  my sword to repel,
<br>&emsp;  my sun to warm.
<br>To enrich me will not diminish thy fullness;
<br>All thy lovingkindness is in thy Son,
<br>I bring him to thee in the arms of faith,
<br>I urge his saving Name as the One who died for me.
<br>I plead his blood to pay my debts of wrong.
<br>Accept his worthiness for my unworthiness,
<br>&emsp;  his sinlessness for my transgressions,
<br>&emsp;  his purity for my uncleanness,
<br>&emsp;  his sincerity for my guile,
<br>&emsp;  his truth for my deceits,
<br>&emsp;  his meekness for my pride,
<br>&emsp;  his constancy for my backslidings,
<br>&emsp;  his love for my enmity,
<br>&emsp;  his fullness for my emptiness,
<br>&emsp;  his faithfulness for my treachery,
<br>&emsp;  his obedience for my lawlessness,
<br>&emsp;  his glory for my shame,
<br>&emsp;  his devotedness for my waywardness,
<br>&emsp;  his holy life for my unchaste ways,
<br>&emsp;  his righteousness for my dead works,
<br>&emsp;  his death for my life.
