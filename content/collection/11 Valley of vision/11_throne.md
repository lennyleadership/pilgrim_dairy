O GOD OF MY DELIGHT,

Thy throne of grace
<br>&emsp;      is the pleasure ground of my soul.
<br>Here I obtain mercy in time of need,
<br>&emsp;  here see the smile of thy reconciled face,
<br>&emsp;  here joy pleads the name of Jesus,
<br>&emsp;  here I sharpen the sword of the Spirit,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      anoint the shield of faith,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      put on the helmet of salvation,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      gather manna from thy Word,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      am strengthened for each conflict,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      nerved for the upward race,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;      empowered to conquer every foe;
<br>Help me to come to Christ
<br>&emsp;  as the fountain head of descending blessings,
<br>&emsp;  as a wide open flood-gate of mercy.
<br>I marvel at my insensate folly, that
<br>&emsp;  with such enriching favours within my reach
<br>&emsp;  I am slow to extend the hand to take them.
<br>Have mercy upon my deadness for thy Nameâ€™s sake.
<br>Quicken me, stir me, fill me with holy zeal.
<br>Strengthen me that I may cling to thee
<br>&emsp;    and not let thee go.
<br>May thy Spirit within me draw all blessings from thy hand.
<br>When I advance not, I backslide.
<br>Let me walk humbly because of good omitted and evil done.
<br>Impress on my mind the shortness of time,
<br>&emsp;  the work to be engaged in,
<br>&emsp;  the account to be rendered,
<br>&emsp;  the nearness of eternity,
<br>&emsp;  the fearful sin of despising thy Spirit.
<br>May I never forget that
<br>&emsp;  thy eye always sees,
<br>&emsp;  thy ear always hears,
<br>&emsp;  thy recording hand always writes.
<br>May I never give thee rest until Christ is
<br>&emsp;  the pulse of my heart;
<br>&emsp;  the spokesman of my lips,
<br>&emsp;  the lamp of my feet.
