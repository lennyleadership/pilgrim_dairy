O GOD OF GRACE,

I bewail my cold, listless, heartless prayers;
<br>&emsp;    their poverty adds sin to sin.
If my hope were in them I should be undone,
But the worth of Jesus perfumes my feeble breathings, and 
<br>&emsp;  wins their acceptance.
Deepen my contrition of heart,
Confirm my faith in the blood that 
<br>&emsp;  washes from all sin.
May I walk lovingly with my great Redeemer.
Flood my soul with true repentance
<br>&emsp;  that my heart may be broken for sin and unto sin.
Let me be as slow to forgive myself
<br>&emsp;  as thou art ready to forgive me.
Gazing on the glories of thy grace
<br>&emsp;  may I be cast into the lowest depths of shame,
<br>&emsp;  and walk with downcast head
<br>&emsp;  now thou art pacified towards me.
O my great High Priest,
<br>&emsp;  pour down upon me streams of needful grace,
<br>&emsp;  bless me in all my undertakings,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;    in every thought of my mind,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;    every word of my lips,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;    every step of my feet,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;    every deed of my hands.
Thou didst live to bless,
<br>&emsp;  die to bless,
<br>&emsp;  rise to bless,
<br>&emsp;  ascend to bless,
<br>&emsp;  take thy throne to bless,
<br>&emsp;  and now thou dost reign to bless.
O give sincerity to my desires,
<br>&emsp;  earnestness to my supplications,
<br>&emsp;  fervour to my love.
