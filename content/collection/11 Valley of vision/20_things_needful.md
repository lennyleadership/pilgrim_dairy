THOU ETERNAL SOURCE,

Author of all created being and happiness,
<br>&emsp;      I adore thee for making man capable of religion,
<br>&emsp;  that he may be taught to say:
<br>&emsp;    ‘Where is God, my Maker, who giveth songs in the night?’
<br>But degeneracy has spread over our human race,
<br>&emsp;  turning glory into shame,
<br>&emsp;  rendering us forgetful of thee.
<br>We know it is thy power alone
<br>&emsp;  that can recall wandering children,
<br>&emsp;  can impress on them a sense of divine things,
<br>&emsp;  and can render that sense lasting and effectual;
<br>From thee proceed all good purposes and desires,
<br>&emsp;  and the diffusing of piety and happiness.
<br>Thou hast knowledge of my soul’s secret principles,
<br>&emsp;  and art aware of my desire to spread the gospel.
<br>Make me an almoner to give thy
<br>&emsp;  bounties to the indigent,
<br>&emsp;  comfort to the mentally ill,
<br>&emsp;  restoration to the sin-diseased,
<br>&emsp;  hope to the despairing,
<br>&emsp;  joy to the sorrowing,
<br>&emsp;  love to the prodigals.
<br>Blow away the ashes of unbelief by thy Spirit’s breath
<br>&emsp;  and give me light, fire, and warmth of love.
<br>I need spiritual comforts
<br>&emsp;  that are gentle, peaceful, mild, refreshing,
<br>&emsp;  that will melt me into conscious lowliness before thee,
<br>&emsp;  that will make me feel and rest in thee as my All.


<br>Fill the garden of my soul with the wind of love,
<br>&emsp;  that the scents of the Christian life may be
<br>&emsp;    wafted to others;
<br>&emsp;  then come and gather fruits to thy glory.
<br>So shall I fulfil the great end of my being —
<br>&emsp;  to glorify thee and be a blessing to men.
