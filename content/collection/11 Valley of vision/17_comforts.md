GIVER OF ALL GOOD,

<b>Streams upon streams of love</b> overflow my path.
<br>&emsp;      Thou hast made me out of nothing,
<br>&emsp;      hast recalled me from a far country,
<br>&emsp;  hast translated me from ignorance to knowledge,
<br>&emsp;      from darkness to light,
<br>&emsp;      from death to life,
<br>&emsp;      from misery to peace,
<br>&emsp;      from folly to wisdom,
<br>&emsp;      from error to truth,
<br>&emsp;      from sin to victory.

<br>Thanks be to thee for my high and holy calling.
<br><b>I bless thee</b> for ministering angels,
<br>&emsp;  for the comfort of thy Word,
<br>&emsp;  for the ordinances of thy church,
<br>&emsp;  for the teaching of thy Spirit,
<br>&emsp;  for thy holy sacraments,
<br>&emsp;  for the communion of saints,
<br>&emsp;  for Christian fellowship,
<br>&emsp;  for the recorded annals of holy lives,
<br>&emsp;  for examples sweet to allure,
<br>&emsp;  for beacons sad to deter.

<br>Thy will is in all thy provisions
<br>&emsp;  to enable me to grow in grace,
<br>&emsp;  and to be meet for thy eternal presence.
<br>My heaven-born faith gives promise of eternal sight,
<br>&emsp;  my new birth a pledge of never-ending life.
<br>I draw near to thee, knowing thou wilt draw near to me.
<br>I ask of thee, believing thou hast already given.
<br>I entrust myself to thee, for thou hast redeemed me.
<br>I bless and adore thee, the eternal God,
<br>&emsp;  for the comfort of these thoughts,
<br>&emsp;    the joy of these hopes.
