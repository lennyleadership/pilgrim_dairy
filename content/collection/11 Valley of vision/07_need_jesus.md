LORD JESUS,

I am blind, be thou my light,
<br>&emsp;    ignorant, be thou my wisdom,
<br>&emsp;    self-willed, be thou my mind.
Open my ear to grasp quickly thy Spirit’s voice,
<br>&emsp;  and delightfully run after his beckoning hand;
<br>Melt my conscience that no hardness remain,
<br>&emsp;  make it alive to evil’s slightest touch;
<br>When Satan approaches may I <b>flee to thy wounds</b>,
<br>&emsp;  and there cease to tremble at all alarms.
<br>Be my good shepherd to lead me into
<br>&emsp;    <b>the green pastures of thy Word</b>,
<br>&emsp;  and cause me to lie down beside <b>the rivers of its comforts</b>.
<br>Fill me with peace, that no disquieting worldly gales
<br>&emsp;  may ruffle the calm <b>surface of my soul</b>.
<br>Thy cross was upraised to be my refuge,
<br>Thy blood streamed forth to wash me clean,
<br>Thy death occurred to give me a surety,
<br>Thy name is my property to save me,
<br>By thee all heaven is poured into my heart,
<br>&emsp;  but it is too narrow to comprehend thy love.
<br>I was a stranger, an outcast, a slave, a rebel,
<br>&emsp;  but thy cross has brought me near,
<br>&emsp;    has softened my heart,
<br>&emsp;    has made me thy Father’s child,
<br>&emsp;    has admitted me to thy family,
<br>&emsp;    has made me joint-heir with thyself.
<br>O that I may love thee as thou lovest me,
<br>&emsp;  that I may walk worthy of thee, my Lord,
<br>&emsp;  that I may reflect the image of heaven’s first-born.
<br>May I always see thy beauty with the clear eye of faith,
<br>&emsp;  and feel the power of thy Spirit in my heart,
<br>&emsp;  for unless he move mightily in me
<br>&emsp;  no inward fire will be kindled.
