O THOU TERRIBLE MEEK,

Let not pride swell my heart.
<br>&emsp;  My nature is the mire beneath my feet,
<br>&emsp;  the dust to which I shall return.
<br>In body I surpass not the meanest reptile;
<br>Whatever difference of form and intellect is mine
<br>&emsp;  is a free grant of thy goodness;
<br>Every faculty of mind and body is thy
<br>&emsp;  undeserved gift.
<br>Low as I am as a creature, I am lower as a sinner;
<br>I have trampled thy law times without number;
<br>Sin’s deformity is stamped upon me,
<br>&emsp;  darkens my brow, touches me with corruption:
<br>How can I flaunt myself proudly?
<br>Lowest abasement is my due place,
<br>&emsp;  for I am less than nothing before thee.
<br>Help me to see myself in thy sight,
<br>&emsp;  then pride must wither, decay, die, perish.
<br>Humble my heart before thee,
<br>&emsp;  and replenish it with thy choicest gifts.
<br>As water rests not on barren hill summits,
<br>&emsp;  but flows down to fertilize lowest vales,
<br>So make me the lowest of the lowly,
<br>&emsp;  that my spiritual riches may exceedingly abound.
<br>When I leave duties undone,
<br>&emsp;  may condemning thought strip me of pride,
<br>&emsp;  deepen in me devotion to thy service,
<br>&emsp;  and quicken me to more watchful care.
<br>When I am tempted to think highly of myself,
<br>&emsp;  grant me to see the wily power of my spiritual enemy;
<br>Help me to stand with wary eye<label for="wary" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">wary eye</span> on the watch-tower of faith,
<br>&emsp;  and to cling with determined grasp to my humble Lord;
<br>If I fall let me hide myself in my Redeemer’s righteousness,
<br>&emsp;  and when I escape, may I ascribe all deliverance to thy grace.
<br>Keep me humble, meek, lowly.
