  <h2>Direction of Focus</h2>
  My Utmost for His Highest
  
  by Oswald Chamber

>Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters…, so our eyes look to the Lord our God… 

>— Psalm 123:2

This verse is a description of total reliance on God. Just as the eyes of a servant are riveted on his master, our eyes should be directed to and focused on God. This is how knowledge of His countenance is gained and how God reveals Himself to us (see Isaiah 53:1). Our spiritual strength begins to be drained when we stop lifting our eyes to Him. Our stamina is sapped, not so much through external troubles surrounding us but through problems in our thinking. We wrongfully think, “I suppose I’ve been stretching myself a little too much, standing too tall and trying to look like God instead of being an ordinary humble person.” We have to realize that no effort can be too high.  

For example, you came to a crisis in your life, took a stand for God, and even had the witness of the Spirit as a confirmation that what you did was right. But now, maybe weeks or years have gone by, and you are slowly coming to the conclusion — "Well, maybe what I did showed too much pride or was superficial. Was I taking a stand a bit too high for me?" Your "rational" friends come and say, "Don’t be silly. We knew when you first talked about this spiritual awakening that it was a passing impulse, that you couldn’t hold up under the strain. And anyway, God doesn’t expect you to endure." You respond by saying, “Well, I suppose I was expecting too much.” That sounds humble to say, but it means that your reliance on God is gone, and you are now relying on worldly opinion. The danger comes when, no longer relying on God, you neglect to focus your eyes on Him. Only when God brings you to a sudden stop will you realize that you have been the loser. Whenever there is a spiritual drain in your life, correct it immediately. Realize that something has been coming between you and God, and change or remove it at once.

<h2>仰望的方向</h2>

看哪，仆人的眼睛怎样望主人的手……我们的眼睛也照样望耶和华我们的神……（诗一二三2）

这节经文是对神完全信赖的描写。仆人的眼如何注视主人，我们的眼也同样仰望神，以致对他的容貌认识日增（赛五十三1）。我们一不仰望神，就产生属灵的漏症。这漏症不是由於外在的烦恼，而是在於我们有这样的幻想：[我想自己伸展得太用力了，用脚尖站立，努力像神，而不作一个谦卑平凡人。]要知道并没有太过竭力这一回事。

例如：你因为神而面临危机，但你有圣灵的印证，知道怎样去作才对。可是随着年日过去，你却逐渐有这样得结论 – [看来，我不是过分自负吗？我所作得不是太【过火】么？]你那些讲理智的朋友说：[别傻啦，你当时说起那个属灵醒觉，我们就看出是一时的冲动，你受不起那种压力的，神也不期望你这样做。]你就会说：[这个，我想自己的期望也太高了。]听来多谦卑，可是对神的信赖已尽失，开始信赖世界的见解。你不再仰赖神，不再抬头注视他，这就是危机。惟有等到神突然把你停住，你才晓得自己是在倒退。所以，一发现有漏症，就该立即补救。要承认在你与神之间有了阻隔，并且要立刻去对付。

祈祷◆噢，主啊，我在举止和行为上何等缓慢地表现神仁慈的恩典！你的美善何时才为着你的荣耀临到我身上？

  <h2>The Distraction of Contempt</h2>

  My Utmost for His Highest
  
  by Oswald Chamber
  
  >*Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.* 
  >*— Psalm 123:3*
  
What we must beware of is not damage to our belief in God but damage to our Christian disposition or <a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "心智">state of mind</a>. “Take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously” (Malachi 2:16). Our state of mind is powerful in its effects. It can be the enemy that penetrates right into our soul and distracts our mind from God. There are certain attitudes we should never dare to <a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "放任">indulge</a>. If we do, we will find they have distracted us from faith in God. Until we get back into a quiet mood before Him, our faith is of no value, and our confidence in the flesh and in human ingenuity is what rules our lives. <a class = "marginnote"> difference: faith vs confidence</a>

Beware of “<a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "今生的忧虑">the cares of this world…</a>” (Mark 4:19). They are the very things that produce the wrong attitudes in our soul. It is incredible what enormous power there is in simple things to distract our attention away from God. Refuse to be <a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "占有">swamped</a> by “the cares of this world.”

Another thing that distracts us is our passion for <a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "好辩">vindication</a>. St. Augustine prayed, “O Lord, deliver me from this lust of always vindicating myself.” Such a need for constant vindication destroys our soul’s faith in God. Don’t say, “I must explain myself,” or, “I must get people to understand.” Our Lord never explained anything— He left the misunderstandings or misconceptions of others to correct themselves.

When we discern that other people are not growing spiritually and allow that discernment to turn to criticism, we block our fellowship with God. God never gives us discernment so that we may criticize, but that we may intercede.

<h2>使信徒分心的事</h2>

>*耶和华啊，求你怜悯我们，怜悯我们因为我们被藐视已到极处。（诗一二三3）*

最要当心的，不是那些破坏我们对神信仰的事，而是破坏我们基督徒性情的事。[所以当谨守你们的心，不可行诡诈。] 心智的影响至大，它是直透人心灵的仇敌，叫人的心偏离神。心智的某些倾向，是绝不容稍有放任的；若放任，就使我们对神的信心偏离。除非回复在神面前安息的心，否则我们对他的信心就尽失，掌管我们的只是对肉体和智慧的信心。

提防[今生的忧虑]，因为这些事叫心灵产生错误的性情。很细微的事也足以分散我们对神的心，其能力之大，叫人诧异。要拒绝被今生的挂虑所占有。

另一分心的事，就是好辩的欲念。圣奥古斯丁祷告说：[主啊，就我脱离自我辩护的情欲。]心智的倾向，会破坏对神的信心。[我一定要为自己解释清楚，我一定要叫人明白。]主从来不解释什么；他让自己更正错处。我们有时察觉别人的属灵生命停滞不前，接着就批评起来；这样，我们就阻塞了通往神的道路。神给我们洞悉力，并不是要我们批评，乃是要我们代求。

祈祷◆多少时候，我发现在我里面的是[驴]，而不是我的智力，[看见耶和华的使者而跨进田间]。主啊，求你加添我属灵的敏锐，以致我可以察觉到你最微小的举动。
