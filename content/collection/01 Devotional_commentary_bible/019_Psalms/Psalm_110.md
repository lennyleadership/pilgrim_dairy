110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.  
110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.  
110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  
110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.  

110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.  
110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. <a class = "marginnote">the subject changes here. Why</a>
