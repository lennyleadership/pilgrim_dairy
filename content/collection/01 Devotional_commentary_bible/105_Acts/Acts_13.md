13:1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.  
13:2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.  
13:3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.  
13:4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.  
13:5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.  

13:6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:  
13:7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.  
13:8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.  
13:9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,  
13:10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?  

13:11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.  
13:12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.  
13:13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.  
13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.  
13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.  

13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.  
13:17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.  
13:18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.  
13:19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.  
13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.  

13:21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.  
13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will. <a class = "marginnote">v22: a man after mine own heart: understand the cross and the blood; God's will: salvation, regeneration/ transformation</a>  
13:23 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:  
13:24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.  
13:25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.  

13:26 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.  
13:27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.  
13:28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.  
13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.  
13:30 But God raised him from the dead:  

13:31 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.  
13:32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,  
13:33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.  
13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.  
13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  

13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:  
13:37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.  
13:38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:  
13:39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.  
13:40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;  

13:41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.  
13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.  
13:43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.  
13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.  
13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.  

13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.  
13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.  
13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.  
13:49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.  
13:50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.  

13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.  
13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

13:1 在安提阿的教会中、有几位先知和教师、就是巴拿巴、和称呼尼结的西面、古利奈人路求、与分封之王希律同养的马念、并扫罗。  
13:2 他们事奉主、禁食的时候、圣灵说、要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗、去作我召他们所作的工。  
13:3 于是禁食祷告、按手在他们头上、就打发他们去了。  
13:4 他们既被圣灵差遣、就下到西流基、从那里坐船往居比路去。  
13:5 到了撒拉米、就在犹太人各会堂里传讲　神的道。也有约翰作他们的帮手。  

13:6 经过全岛、直到帕弗、在那里遇见一个有法术假充先知的犹太人、名叫巴耶稣。  
13:7 这人常和方伯士求保罗同在、士求保罗是个通达人。他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来、要听　神的道。  
13:8 只是那行法术的以吕马、（这名翻出来就是行法术的意思)敌挡使徒、要叫方伯不信真道。  
13:9 扫罗又名保罗、被圣灵充满、定睛看他、  
13:10 说、你这充满各样诡诈奸恶、魔鬼的儿子、众善的仇敌、你混乱主的正道还不止住么。  

13:11 现在主的手加在你身上。你要瞎眼、暂且不见日光。他的眼睛、立刻昏蒙黑暗、四下里求人拉着手领他。  
13:12 方伯看见所作的事、很希奇主的道、就信了。  
13:13 保罗和他的同人、从帕弗开船、来到旁非利亚的别加。约翰就离开他们回耶路撒冷去。  
13:14 他们离了别加往前行、来到彼西底的安提阿。在安息日进会堂坐下。  
13:15 读完了律法和先知的书、管会堂的叫人过去、对他们说、二位兄台、若有甚么劝勉众人的话、请说。  

13:16 保罗就站起来、举手说、以色列人、和一切敬畏　神的人、请听。  
13:17 这以色列民的　神、拣选了我们的祖宗、当民寄居埃及的时候、抬举他们、用大能的手领他们出来。  
13:18 又在旷野容忍他们约有四十年。〔容忍或作抚养〕
13:19 既灭了迦南地七族的人、就把那地分给他们为业。  
13:20 此后、给他们设立士师、约有四百五十年、直到先知撒母耳的时候。  

13:21 后来他们求一个王、　神就将便雅悯支派中、基士的儿子扫罗、给他们作王四十年。  
13:22 既废了扫罗、就选立大卫作他们的王。又为他作见证说、『我寻得耶西的儿子大卫、他是合我心意的人、凡事要遵行我的旨意。』  
13:23 从这人的后裔中、　神已经照着所应许的、为以色列人立了一位救主、就是耶稣。  
13:24 在他没有出来以先、约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。  
13:25 约翰将行尽他的程途说、你们以为我是谁、我不是基督。只是有一位在我以后来的、我解他脚上的鞋带、也是不配的。  

13:26 弟兄们、亚伯拉罕的子孙、和你们中间敬畏　神的人哪、这救世的道、是传给我们的。  
13:27 耶路撒冷居住的人、和他们的官长、因为不认识基督、也不明白每安息日所读众先知的书、就把基督定了死罪、正应了先知的预言。  
13:28 虽然查不出他有当死的罪来、还是求彼拉多杀他。  
13:29 既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话、就把他从木头上取下来、放在坟墓里。  
13:30 　神却叫他从死里复活。  

13:31 那从加利利同他上耶路撒冷的人多日看见他、这些人如今在民间是他的见证。  
13:32 我们也报好信息给你们、就是那应许祖宗的话、  
13:33 　神已经向我们这作儿女的应验、叫耶稣复活了。正如诗篇第二篇上记着说、『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』  
13:34 论到　神叫他从死里复活、不再归于朽坏、就这样说、『我必将所应许大卫那圣洁可靠的恩典、赐给你们。』  
13:35 又有一篇上说、『你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。』  

13:36 大卫在世的时候、遵行了　神的旨意、就睡了、〔或作大卫按　神的旨意服事了他那一世的人就睡了〕归到他祖宗那里、已见朽坏。  
13:37 惟独　神所复活的、他并未见朽坏。  
13:38 所以弟兄们、你们当晓得、赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。  
13:39 你们靠摩西的律法、在一切不得称义的事上、信靠这人、就都得称义了。  
13:40 所以你们务要小心、免得先知书上所说的临到你们。  

13:41 主说、『你们这轻慢的人要观看、要惊奇、要灭亡。因为在你们的时候、我行一件事、虽有人告诉你们、你们总是不信。』  
13:42 他们出会堂的时候、众人请他们到下安息日、再讲这话给他们听。  
13:43 散会以后、犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人、多有跟从保罗、巴拿巴的、二人对他们讲道、劝他们务要恒久在　神的恩中。  
13:44 到下安息日、合城的人、几乎都来聚集、要听　神的道。  
13:45 但犹太人看见人这样多、就满心嫉妒、硬驳保罗所说的话、并且毁谤。  

13:46 保罗和巴拿巴放胆说、　神的道先讲给你们、原是应当的、只因你们弃绝这道、断定自己不配得永生、我们就转向外邦人去。  
13:47 因为主曾这样吩咐我们说、『我已经立你作外邦人的光、叫你施行救恩直到地极。』  
13:48 外邦人听见这话、就欢喜了、赞美　神的道。凡预定得永生的人都信了。  
13:49 于是主的道、传遍了那一带地方。  
13:50 但犹太人挑唆虔敬尊贵的妇女、和城内有名望的人、逼迫保罗、巴拿巴、将他们赶出境外。  

13:51 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土、就往以哥念去了。  
13:52 门徒满心喜乐、又被圣灵充满。

神确定的法则  
[..·我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。] (徒十三 22)  

神要建造以色列人成为一个国度，这是神为着袖子民的旨意。神的旨意并不是要让他的子民们四散、分开或是软弱，神的旨意乃是要池的子民们被结合而刚强。但是在神实现他的旨意和目的之前，首先要寻找一个合适的器皿换句话说，神关心人更重过工作。神是有一个工作要做，但如果袖不能找到那对的人，他会等待直到他得着了对的人，才开始那对的工作这乃是神确定的法则。  

摘自《神说话了》(江守道)

----

Brother L: “合神心意”的教会牧者或者长老会是谁？  

在我看来，神的旨意不单单是说：“并不是要让他的子民们四散、分开或是软弱，神的旨意乃是要池的子民们被结合而刚强。”在属灵的层面上讲，应该是：上帝愿人人都得救，人人的生命都被改造、被建造。"yet not I but through Christ in me."  

如果我们不持守简单的福音，转而去借助世人的方式使信徒得到心灵的满足，生命反而原地踏步，我们就不是“合神心意”的教会牧者或者长老。  

Brother D: 教會裡有小子，有少年人，有父老。做長老的，一般比小子和少年人更成熟，認識經歷神更深一些，體力方面又比父老更健壯。所以被託付來照管教會，照顧群羊。  

Sister G: 世界人透过教会牧者长老的服事生命，去观察他们众徒们的生命，就可以查验看到，那个教会牧师者或长老是否有基督的生命。是否是真正‘合神心意’的教会牧师或者长老了。  
耶稣是地上教会牧榜样。
