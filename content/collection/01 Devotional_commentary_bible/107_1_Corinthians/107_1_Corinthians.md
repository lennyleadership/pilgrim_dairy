1 Corinthians Chapter 1  
1:1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,  
1:2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:  
1:3 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ:  
1:5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge:  

1:6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:  
1:7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:  
1:8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  
1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.  

1:11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.  
1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.  
1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?  
1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius:  
1:15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.  

1:16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.  
1:17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.  
1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.  
1:19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.  
1:20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  

1:21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  
1:22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:  
1:23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness:  
1:24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.  
1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  

1:26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:  
1:27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty:  
1:28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:  
1:29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.  
1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:  

1:31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

1 Corinthians Chapter 2  
2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.  
2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  
2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.  
2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:  
2:5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.  

2:6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:  
2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:  
2:8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  
2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.  
2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  

2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  
2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  
2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  
2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.  

2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

1 Corinthians Chapter 3   
3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.  
3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.  
3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?  
3:4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?  
3:5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?  

3:6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.  
3:7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  
3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.  
3:9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.  
3:10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  

3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.  
3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:  
3:13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.  
3:14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  
3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.  

3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  
3:17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.  
3:18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.  
3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.  
3:20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.  

3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours:  
3:22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours:  
3:23 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

1 Corinthians Chapter 4   
4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.  
4:2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.  
4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.  
4:4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.  
4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.  

4:6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.  
4:7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?  
4:8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.  
4:9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.  
4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.  

4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace:  
4:12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:  
4:13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.  
4:14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.  
4:15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.  

4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.  
4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.  
4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.  
4:19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.  
4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.  

4:21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

1 Corinthians Chapter 5  
5:1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.  
5:2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.  
5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,  
5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.  

5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?  
5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  
5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  
5:9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:  
5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.  

5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.  
5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?  
5:13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 6  
6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?  
6:2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  
6:3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?  
6:4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.  
6:5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?  

6:6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.  
6:7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  
6:8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.  
6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  
6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  

6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  
6:12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  
6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.  
6:14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.  
6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.  

6:16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  
6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  
6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  
6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  
6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 7  
7:1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.  
7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.  
7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.  
7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  
7:5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.  

7:6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.  
7:7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  
7:8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  
7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  
7:10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  

7:11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  
7:12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  
7:13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  
7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  
7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  

7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?  
7:17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  
7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  
7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  
7:20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  

7:21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  
7:22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.  
7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  
7:24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  
7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  

7:26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  
7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  
7:28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  
7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none:  
7:30 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not:  

7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  
7:32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  
7:33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  
7:34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  
7:35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  

7:36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  
7:37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  
7:38 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  
7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  
7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 8  
8:1 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.  
8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.  
8:3 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.  
8:4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.  
8:5 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

8:6 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.  
8:7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.  
8:8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.  
8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.  
8:10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols:  

8:11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?  
8:12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.  
8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 9   
9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?  
9:2 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.  
9:3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,  
9:4 Have we not power to eat and to drink?  
9:5 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?  

9:6 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?  
9:7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  
9:8 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?  
9:9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?  
9:10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.  

9:11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?  
9:12 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.  
9:13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?  
9:14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.  
9:15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.  

9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
9:17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.  
9:18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.  
9:19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.  
9:20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law:  

9:21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.  
9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.  
9:23 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.  
9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.  
9:25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.  

9:26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:  
9:27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 10  
10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea:  
10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea:  
10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat:  
10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.  
10:5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.  

10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.  
10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.  
10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.  
10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.  
10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.  

10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.  
10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.  
10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.  
10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.  
10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.  

10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  
10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.  
10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  
10:19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  
10:20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  

10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.  
10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?  
10:23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.  
10:24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.  
10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:  

10:26 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.  
10:27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.  
10:28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:  
10:29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?  
10:30 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  

10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  
10:32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:  
10:33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

1 Corinthians Chapter 11  
11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.  
11:2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.  
11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.  
11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.  
11:5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.  

11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.  
11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.  
11:8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.  
11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.  
11:10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.  

11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.  
11:12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.  
11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?  
11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?  
11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.  

11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.  
11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.  
11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.  
11:19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.  
11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.  

11:21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.  
11:22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  
11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  
11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  
11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  

11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  
11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  
11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.  
11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.  
11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  

11:31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  
11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  
11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  
11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 12  
12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  
12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.  
12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.  
12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.  
12:5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.  

12:6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.  
12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.  
12:8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit:  
12:9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit:  
12:10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:  

12:11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.  
12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.  
12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.  
12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.  
12:15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?  

12:16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?  
12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  
12:18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.  
12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?  
12:20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.  

12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  
12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:  
12:23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  
12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:  
12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.  

12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.  
12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.  
12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.  
12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?  
12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?  

12:31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 13  
13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.  
13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.  
13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.  
13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,  
13:5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil:  

13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth:  
13:7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.  
13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.  
13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  
13:10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.  

13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.  
13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.  
13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 14  
14:1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.  
14:2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.  
14:3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.  
14:4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.  
14:5 I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.  

14:6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  
14:7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?  
14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?  
14:9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.  
14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.  

14:11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.  
14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.  
14:13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.  
14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.  
14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  

14:16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  
14:17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  
14:18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  
14:19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  
14:20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  

14:21 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.  
14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  
14:23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  
14:24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  
14:25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  

14:26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  
14:27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  
14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  
14:29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  
14:30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  

14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  
14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  
14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  
14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  
14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  

14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  
14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  
14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  
14:39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  
14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 15   
15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand:  
15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  
15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures:  
15:4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  
15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  

15:6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.  
15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.  
15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.  
15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  
15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.  

15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.  
15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?  
15:13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:  
15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.  
15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.  

15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:  
15:17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.  
15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.  
15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.  
15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.  

15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  
15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  
15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.  
15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.  
15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  

15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  
15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  
15:28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  
15:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  
15:30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  

15:31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.  
15:32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  
15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  
15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  
15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  

15:36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  
15:37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  
15:38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  
15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  
15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  

15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  
15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  
15:43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  
15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  
15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  

15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  
15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  
15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  
15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  
15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  

15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  
15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  
15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  
15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  
15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?  

15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.  
15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 16   
16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.  
16:2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.  
16:3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.  
16:4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.  
16:5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.  

16:6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.  
16:7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.  
16:8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.  
16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.  
16:10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.  

16:11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.  
16:12 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.  
16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.  
16:14 Let all your things be done with charity.  
16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

16:16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.  
16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.  
16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.  
16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.  
16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.  

16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.  
16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.  
16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  
16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.  



哥林多前书 1章  

1:1 奉　神旨意、蒙召作耶稣基督使徒的保罗、同兄弟所提尼、  
1:2 写信给在哥林多　神的教会、就是在基督耶稣里成圣、蒙召作圣徒的、以及所有在各处求告我主耶稣基督之名的人。基督是他们的主、也是我们的主。  
1:3 愿恩惠平安、从　神我们的父、并主耶稣基督、归与你们。  
1:4 我常为你们感谢我的　神、因　神在基督耶稣里所赐给你们的恩惠。  
1:5 又因你们在他里面凡事富足、口才知识都全备。  

1:6 正如我为基督作的见证、在你们心里得以坚固。  
1:7 以致你们在恩赐上没有一样不及人的。等候我们的主耶稣基督显现。  
1:8 他也必坚固你们到底、叫你们在我们主耶稣基督的日子、无可责备。  
1:9 　神是信实的、你们原是被他所召、好与他儿子、我们的主耶稣基督、一同得分。  
1:10 弟兄们、我借我们主耶稣基督的名、劝你们都说一样的话。你们中间也不可分党。只要一心一意彼此相合。  

1:11 因为革来氏家里的人、曾对我提起弟兄们来、说你们中间有分争。  
1:12 我的意思就是你们各人说、我是属保罗的。我是属亚波罗的。我是属矶法的。我是属基督的。  
1:13 基督是分开的么。保罗为你们钉了十字架么。你们是奉保罗的名受了洗么。  
1:14 我感谢　神、除了基利司布并该犹以外、我没有给你们一个人施洗。  
1:15 免得有人说、你们是奉我的名受洗。  

1:16 我也给司提反家施过洗。此外给别人施洗没有、我却记不清。  
1:17 基督差遣我、原不是为施洗、乃是为传福音。并不用智慧的言语、免得基督的十字架落了空。  
1:18 因为十字架的道理、在那灭亡的人为愚拙。在我们得救的人却为　神的大能。  
1:19 就如经上所记、『我要灭绝智慧人的智慧、废弃聪明人的聪明。』  
1:20 智慧人在那里。文士在那里。这世上的辩士在那里。　神岂不是叫这世上的智慧变成愚拙么。  

1:21 世人凭自己的智慧、既不认识　神、　神就乐意用人所当作愚拙的道理、拯救那些信的人。这就是　神的智慧了。  
1:22 犹太人是要神迹、希利尼人是求智慧。  
1:23 我们却是传钉十字架的基督、在犹太人为绊脚石、在外邦人为愚拙、  
1:24 但在那蒙召的、无论是犹太人、希利尼人、基督总为　神的能力、　神的智慧。  
1:25 因　神的愚拙总比人智慧。　神的软弱总比人强壮。  

1:26 弟兄们哪、可见你们蒙召的、按着肉体有智慧的不多、有能力的不多、有尊贵的也不多。  
1:27 　神却拣选了世上愚拙的、叫有智慧的羞愧。又拣选了世上软弱的、叫那强壮的羞愧。  
1:28 　神也拣选了世上卑贱的、被人厌恶的、以及那无有的、为要废掉那有的。  
1:29 使一切有血气的、在　神面前一个也不能自夸。  
1:30 但你们得在基督耶稣里、是本乎　神、　神又使他成为我们的智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。  

1:31 如经上所记、『夸口的当指着主夸口。』  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 2章 

2:1 弟兄们、从前我到你们那里去、并没有用高言大智对你们宣传　神的奥秘。  
2:2 因为我曾定了主意、在你们中间不知道别的、只知道耶稣基督、并他钉十字架。  
2:3 我在你们那里、又软弱、又惧怕、又甚战兢。  
2:4 我说的话讲的道、不是用智慧委婉的言语、乃是用圣灵和大能的明证。  
2:5 叫你们的信不在乎人的智慧、只在乎　神的大能。  

2:6 然而在完全的人中、我们也讲智慧。但不是这世上的智慧、也不是这世上有权有位将要败亡之人的智慧。  
2:7 我们讲的、乃是从前所隐藏、　神奥秘的智慧、就是　神在万世以前、预定使我们得荣耀的。  
2:8 这智慧世上有权有位的人没有一个知道的。他们若知道、就不把荣耀的主钉在十字架上了。  
2:9 如经上所记、『　神为爱他的人所预备的、是眼睛未曾看见、耳朵未曾听见、人心也未曾想到的。』  
2:10 只有　神借着圣灵向我们显明了。因为圣灵参透万事、就是　神深奥的事也参透了。  

2:11 除了在人里头的灵、谁知道人的事。像这样、除了　神的灵、也没有人知道　神的事。  
2:12 我们所领受的、并不是世上的灵、乃是从　神来的灵、叫我们能知道　神开恩赐给我们的事。  
2:13 并且我们讲说这些事、不是用人智慧所指教的言语、乃是用圣灵所指教的言语、将属灵的话、解释属灵的事。〔或作将属灵的事讲与属灵的人〕  
2:14 然而属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事、反倒以为愚拙。并且不能知道、因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。  
2:15 属灵的人能看透万事、却没有一人能看透了他。  

2:16 谁曾知道主的心去教导他呢。但我们是有基督的心了。

哥林多前书 3章  

3:1 弟兄们、我从前对你们说话、不能把你们当作属灵的、只得把你们当作属肉体、在基督里为婴孩的。  
3:2 我是用奶喂你们、没有用饭喂你们。那时你们不能吃、就是如今还是不能。  
3:3 你们仍是属肉体的。因为在你们中间有嫉妒分争、这岂不是属乎肉体、照着世人的样子行么。  
3:4 有说、我是属保罗的。有说、我是属亚波罗的。这岂不是你们和世人一样么。  
3:5 亚波罗算甚么。保罗算甚么。无非是执事、照主所赐给他们各人的、引导你们相信。  

3:6 我栽种了、亚波罗浇灌了。惟有　神叫他生长。  
3:7 可见栽种的算不得甚么、浇灌的也算不得甚么。只在那叫他生长的　神。  
3:8 栽种的和浇灌的都是一样。但将来各人要照自己的工夫、得自己的赏赐。  
3:9 因为我们是与　神同工的。你们是　神所耕种的田地、所建造的房屋。  
3:10 我照　神所给我的恩、好像一个聪明的工头、立好了根基、有别人在上面建造。只是各人要谨慎怎样在上面建造。  

3:11 因为那已经立好的根基、就是耶稣基督、此外没有人能立别的根基。  
3:12 若有人用金、银、宝石、草木、禾楷、在这根基上建造。  
3:13 各人的工程必然显露。因为那日子要将他表明出来、有火发现。这火要试验各人的工程怎样。  
3:14 人在那根基上所建造的工程、若存得住、他就要得赏赐。  
3:15 人的工程若被烧了、他就要受亏损。自己却要得救。虽然得救乃像从火里经过的一样。  

3:16 岂不知你们是　神的殿、　神的灵住在你们里头么。  
3:17 若有人毁坏　神的殿、　神必要毁坏那人。因为　神的殿是圣的、这殿就是你们。  
3:18 人不可自欺。你们中间若有人、在这世界自以为有智慧、倒不如变作愚拙、好成为有智慧的。  
3:19 因这世界的智慧、在　神看是愚拙。如经上记着说、『主叫有智慧的中了自己的诡计。』  
3:20 又说、『主知道智慧人的意念是虚妄的。』  

3:21 所以无论谁、都不可拿人夸口。因为万有全是你们的。  
3:22 或保罗、或亚波罗、或矶法、或世界、或生、或死、或现今的事、或将来的事、全是你们的。  
3:23 并且你们是属基督的。基督又是属　神的。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 4章  

4:1 人应当以我们为基督的执事、为　神奥秘事的管家。  
4:2 所求于管家的、是要他有忠心。  
4:3 我被你们论断、或被别人论断、我都以为极小的事。连我自己也不论断自己。  
4:4 我虽不觉得自己有错、却也不能因此得以称义。但判断我的乃是主。  
4:5 所以时候未到、甚么都不要论断、只等主来、他要照出暗中的隐情、显明人心的意念。那时各人要从　神那里得着称赞。  

4:6 弟兄们、我为你们的缘故、拿这些事转比自己和亚波罗。叫你们效法我们不可过于圣经所记。免得你们自高自大、贵重这个、轻看那个。  
4:7 使你与人不同的是谁呢。你有甚么不是领受的呢。若是领受的、为何自夸、彷彿不是领受的呢。  
4:8 你们已经饱足了、已经丰富了、不用我们、自己就作王了。我愿意你们果真作王、叫我们也得与你们一同作王。  
4:9 我想　神把我们使徒明明列在末后、好像定死罪的囚犯。因为我们成了一台戏、给世人和天使观看。  
4:10 我们为基督的缘故算是愚拙的、你们在基督里倒是聪明的、我们软弱、你们倒强壮。你们有荣耀、我们倒被藐视。  

4:11 直到如今、我们还是又饥、又渴、又赤身露体、又挨打、又没有一定的住处。  
4:12 并且劳苦、亲手作工。被人咒骂、我们就祝福。被人逼迫、我们就忍受。  
4:13 被人毁谤、我们就善劝。直到如今、人还把我们看作世界上的污秽、万物中的渣滓。  
4:14 我写这话、不是叫你们羞愧、乃是警戒你们、好像我所亲爱的儿女一样。  
4:15 你们学基督的、师傅虽有一万、为父的却是不多、因我在基督耶稣里用福音生了你们。  

4:16 所以我求你们效法我。  
4:17 因此我已打发提摩太到你们那里去。他在主里面、是我所亲爱有忠心的儿子。他必提醒你们、记念我在基督里怎样行事、在各处各教会中怎样教导人。  
4:18 有些人自高自大、以为我不到你们那里去。  
4:19 然而主若许我、我必快到你们那里去。并且我所要知道的、不是那些自高自大之人的言语、乃是他们的权能。  
4:20 因为　神的国不在乎言语、乃在乎权能。  

4:21 你们愿意怎么样呢。是愿意我带着刑杖到你们那里去呢、还是要我存慈爱温柔的心呢。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 5章  

5:1 风闻在你们中间有淫乱的事。这样的淫乱、连外邦人中也没有、就是有人收了他的继母。  
5:2 你们还是自高自大、并不哀痛、把行这事的人从你们中间赶出去。  
5:3 我身子虽不在你们那里、心却在你们那里、好像我亲自与你们同在、已经判断了行这事的人、  
5:4 就是你们聚会的时候、我的心也同在、奉我们主耶稣的名、并用我们主耶稣的权能、  
5:5 要把这样的人交给撒但、败坏他的肉体、使他的灵魂在主耶稣的日子可以得救。  

5:6 你们这自夸是不好的。岂不知一点面酵能使全团发起来么。  
5:7 你们既是无酵的面、应当把旧酵除净、好使你们成为新团。因为我们逾越节的羔羊基督、已经被杀献祭了。  
5:8 所以我们守这节不可用旧酵、也不可用恶毒〔或作阴毒〕邪恶的酵、只用诚实真正的无酵饼。  
5:9 我先前写信给你们说、不可与淫乱的人相交。  
5:10 此话不是指这世上一概行淫乱的、或贪婪的、勒索的、或拜偶像的、若是这样、你们除非离开世界方可。  

5:11 但如今我写信给你们说、若有称为弟兄、是行淫乱的、或贪婪的、或拜偶像的、或辱骂的、或醉酒的、或勒索的。这样的人不可与他相交。就是与他吃饭都不可。  
5:12 因为审判教外的人与我何干。教内的人岂不是你们审判的么。  
5:13 至于外人有　神审判他们。你们应当把那恶人从你们中间赶出去。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 6章  

6:1 你们中间有彼此相争的事、怎敢在不义的人面前求审、不在圣徒面前求审呢。  
6:2 岂不知圣徒要审判世界么。若世界为你们所审、难道你们不配审判这最小的事么。  
6:3 岂不知我们要审判天使么、何况今生的事呢。  
6:4 既是这样、你们若有今生的事当审判、是派教会所轻看的人审判么。  
6:5 我说这话、是要叫你们羞耻。难道你们中间没有一个智慧人、能审断弟兄们的事么。  

6:6 你们竟是弟兄与弟兄告状、而且告在不信主的人面前。  
6:7 你们彼此告状、这已经是你们的大错了。为甚么不情愿受欺呢。为甚么不情愿吃亏呢。  
6:8 你们倒是欺压人、亏负人、况且所欺压所亏负的就是弟兄。  
6:9 你们岂不知、不义的人不能承受　神的国么。不要自欺。无论是淫乱的、拜偶像的、奸淫的、作娈童的、亲男色的、  
6:10 偷窃的、贪婪的、醉酒的、辱骂的、勒索的、都不能承受　神的国。  

6:11 你们中间也有人从前是这样。但如今你们奉主耶稣基督的名、并借着我们　神的灵、已经洗净、成圣称义了。  
6:12 凡事我都可行。但不都有益处。凡事我都可行、但无论那一件、我总不受他的辖制。  
6:13 食物是为肚腹、肚腹是为食物。但　神要叫这两样都废坏。身子不是为淫乱、乃是为主。主也是为身子。  
6:14 并且　神已经叫主复活、也要用自己的能力叫我们复活。  
6:15 岂不知你们的身子是基督的肢体么。我可以将基督的肢体作为娼妓的肢体么。断乎不可。  

6:16 岂不知与娼妓联合的、便是与他成为一体么。因为主说、『二人要成为一体。』  
6:17 但与主联合的、便是与主成为一灵。  
6:18 你们要逃避淫行。人所犯的、无论甚么罪、都在身子以外。惟有行淫的、是得罪自己的身子。  
6:19 岂不知你们的身子就是圣灵的殿么。这圣灵是从　神而来、住在你们里头的。并且你们不是自己的人。  
6:20 因为你们是重价买来的。所以要在你们的身子上荣耀　神。  


------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 7章  

7:1 论到你们信上所提的事、我说男不近女倒好。  
7:2 但要免淫乱的事、男子当各有自己的妻子、女子也当各有自己的丈夫。  
7:3 丈夫当用合宜之分待妻子、妻子待丈夫也要如此。  
7:4 妻子没有权柄主张自己的身子、乃在丈夫。丈夫也没有权柄主张自己的身子、乃在妻子。  
7:5 夫妻不可彼此亏负、除非两相情愿、暂时分房、为要专心祷告方可、以后仍要同房、免得撒但趁着你们情不自禁、引诱你们。  

7:6 我说这话、原是准你们的、不是命你们的。  
7:7 我愿意众人像我一样。只是各人领受　神的恩赐、一个是这样、一个是那样。  
7:8 我对着没有嫁娶的和寡妇说、若他们常像我就好。  
7:9 倘若自己禁止不住、就可以嫁娶。与其欲火攻心、倒不如嫁娶为妙。  
7:10 至于那已经嫁娶的、我吩咐他们、其实不是我吩咐、乃是主吩咐、说、妻子不可离开丈夫。  

7:11 若是离开了、不可再嫁。或是仍同丈夫和好。丈夫也不可离弃妻子。  
7:12 我对其余的人说、不是主说、倘若某弟兄有不信的妻子、妻子也情愿和他同住、他就不要离弃妻子。  
7:13 妻子有不信的丈夫、丈夫也情愿和他同住、他就不要离弃丈夫。  
7:14 因为不信的丈夫、就因着妻子成了圣洁。并且不信的妻子、就因着丈夫成了圣洁。〔丈夫原文作弟兄〕不然、你们的儿女就不洁净。但如今他们是圣洁的了。  
7:15 倘若那不信的人要离去、就由他离去吧。无论是弟兄、是姐妹、遇着这样的事、都不必拘束。　神召我们原是要我们和睦。  

7:16 你这作妻子的、怎么知道不能救你的丈夫呢。你这作丈夫的、怎么知道不能救你的妻子呢。  
7:17 只要照主所分给各人的、和　神所召各人的而行。我吩咐各教会都是这样。  
7:18 有人已受割礼蒙召呢、就不要废割礼。有人未受割礼蒙召呢、就不要受割礼。  
7:19 受割礼算不得甚么、不受割礼也算不得甚么、只要守　神的诫命就是了。  
7:20 各人蒙召的时候是甚么身分、仍要守住这身分。  

7:21 你是作奴隶蒙召的么、不要因此忧虑。若能以自由、就求自由更好。  
7:22 因为作奴仆蒙召于主的、就是主所释放的人。作自由之人蒙召的、就是基督的奴仆。  
7:23 你们是重价买来的。不要作人的奴仆。  
7:24 弟兄们、你们各人蒙召的时候是甚么身分、仍要在　神面前守住这身分。  
7:25 论到童身的人、我没有主的命令、但我既蒙主怜恤、能作忠心的人、就把自己的意见告诉你们。  

7:26 因现今的艰难、据我看来、人不如守素安常才好。  
7:27 你有妻子缠着呢、就不要求脱离。你没有妻子缠着呢、就不要求妻子。  
7:28 你若娶妻、并不是犯罪。处女若出嫁、也不是犯罪。然而这等人肉身必受苦难。我却愿意你们免这苦难。  
7:29 弟兄们、我对你们说、时候减少了。从此以后、那有妻子的、要像没有妻子。  
7:30 哀哭的、要像不哀哭。快乐的、要像不快乐、置买的、要像无有所得。  

7:31 用世物的、要像不用世物。因为这世界的样子将要过去了。  
7:32 我愿你们无所挂虑。没有娶妻的、是为主的事挂虑、想怎样叫主喜悦。  
7:33 娶了妻的、是为世上的事挂虑、想怎样叫妻子喜悦。  
7:34 妇人和处女也有分别。没有出嫁的、是为主的事挂虑、要身体灵魂都圣洁。已经出嫁的、是为世上的事挂虑、想怎样叫丈夫喜悦。  
7:35 我说这话、是为你们的益处。不是要牢笼你们、乃是要叫你们行合宜的事、得以殷勤服事主、没有分心的事。  

7:36 若有人以为自己待他的女儿不合宜、女儿也过了年岁、事又当行、他就可随意办理、不算有罪、叫二人成亲就是了。  
7:37 倘若人心里坚定、没有不得已的事、并且由得自己作主、心里又决定了留下女儿不出嫁、如此行也好。  
7:38 这样看来、叫自己的女儿出嫁是好。不叫他出嫁更是好。  
7:39 丈夫活着的时候、妻子是被约束的。丈夫若死了、妻子就可以自由、随意再嫁。只是要嫁这在主里面的人。  
7:40 然而按我的意见、若常守节更有福气。我也想自己是被　神的灵感动了。  


------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 8章  

8:1 论到祭偶像之物、我们晓得我们都有知识。但知识是叫人自高自大、惟有爱心能造就人。  
8:2 若有人以为自己知道甚么、按他所当知道的、他仍是不知道。  
8:3 若有人爱　神、这人乃是　神所知道的。  
8:4 论到吃祭偶像之物、我们知道偶像在世上算不得甚么。也知道　神只有一位、再没有别的　神。  
8:5 虽有称为　神的、或在天、或在地。就如那许多的　神、许多的主。  

8:6 然而我们只有一位　神、就是父万物都本于他、我们也归于他。并有一位主、就是耶稣基督、万物都是借着他有的、我们也是借着他有的。  
8:7 但人不都有这等知识。有人到如今因拜惯了偶像、就以为所吃的是祭偶像之物。他们的良心既然软弱、也就污秽了。  
8:8 其实食物不能叫　神看中我们。因为我们不吃也无损、吃也无益。  
8:9 只是你们要谨慎、恐怕你们这自由、竟成了那软弱人的绊脚石。  
8:10 若有人见你这有知识的、在偶像的庙里坐席、这人的良心、若是软弱、岂不放胆去吃那祭偶像之物么。  

8:11 因此、基督为他死的那软弱弟兄、也就因你的知识沉沦了。  
8:12 你们这样得罪弟兄们、伤了他们软弱的良心、就是得罪基督。  
8:13 所以食物若叫我弟兄跌倒、我就永远不吃肉、免得叫我弟兄跌倒了。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 9章  

9:1 我不是自由的么。我不是使徒么。我不是见过我们的主耶稣么。你们不是我在主里面所作之工么。  
9:2 假若在别人我不是使徒、在你们我总是使徒。因为你们在主里正是我作使徒的印证。  
9:3 我对那盘问我的人、就是这样分诉。  
9:4 难道我们没有权柄靠福音吃喝么。  
9:5 难道我们没有权柄娶信主的姊妹为妻、带着一同往来、彷彿其余的使徒、和主的弟兄、并矶法一样么。  

9:6 独有我与巴拿巴没有权柄不作工么。  
9:7 有谁当兵、自备粮饷呢。有谁栽葡萄园、不吃园里的果子呢。有谁牧养牛羊、不吃牛羊的奶呢。  
9:8 我说这话、岂是照人的意见。律法不也是这样说么。  
9:9 就如摩西的律法记着说、『牛在场上踹谷的时候、不可笼住他的嘴。』难道　神所挂念的是牛么。  
9:10 不全是为我们说的么。分明是为我们说的。因为耕种的当存着指望去耕种。打场的也当存得粮的指望去打场。  

9:11 我们若把属灵的种子撒在你们中间、就是从你们收割奉养肉身之物、这还算大事么。  
9:12 若别人在你们身上有这权柄、何况我们呢。然而我们没有用过这权柄、倒凡事忍受、免得基督的福音被阻隔。  
9:13 你们岂不知为圣事劳碌的、就吃殿中的物么。伺候祭坛的、就分领坛上的物么。  
9:14 主也是这样命定、叫传福音的靠着福音养生。  
9:15 但这权柄我全没有用过。我写这话、并非要你们这样待我。因为我宁可死、也不叫人使我所夸的落了空。  

9:16 我传福音原没有可夸的。因为我是不得已的。若不传福音、我便有祸了。  
9:17 我若甘心作这事、就有赏赐。若不甘心、责任却已经托付我了。  
9:18 既是这样、我的赏赐是甚么呢。就是我传福音的时候、叫人不花钱得福音、免得用尽我传福音的权柄。  
9:19 我虽是自由的、无人辖管、然而我甘心作了众人的仆人、为要多得人。  
9:20 向犹太人、我就作犹太人、为要得犹太人。向律法以下的人、我虽不在律法以下、还是作律法以下的人、为要得律法以下的人。  

9:21 向没有律法的人、我就作没有律法的人、为要得没有律法的人。其实我在　神面前、不是没有律法、在基督面前、正在律法之下。  
9:22 向软弱的人、我就作软弱的人、为要得软弱的人。向甚么样的人、我就作甚么样的人。无论如何、总要救些人。  
9:23 凡我所行的、都是为福音的缘故、为要与人同得这福音的好处。  
9:24 岂不知在场上赛跑的都跑、但得奖赏的只有一人。你们也当这样跑、好叫你们得着奖赏。  
9:25 凡较力争胜的、诸事都有节制。他们不过是要得能坏的冠冕。我们却是要得不能坏的冠冕。  

9:26 所以我奔跑、不像无定向的。我斗拳、不像打空气的。  
9:27 我是攻克己身、叫身服我。恐怕我传福音给别人、自己反被弃绝了。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 10章  

10:1 弟兄们、我不愿意你们不晓得、我们的祖宗从前都在云下、都从海中经过。  
10:2 都在云里海里受洗归了摩西。  
10:3 并且都吃了一样的灵食。  
10:4 也都喝了一样的灵水。所喝的是出于随着他们的灵磐石。那磐石就是基督。  
10:5 但他们中间、多半是　神不喜欢的人。所以在旷野倒毙。  

10:6 这些事都是我们的鉴戒、叫我们不要贪恋恶事、像他们那样贪恋的。  
10:7 也不要拜偶像、像他们有人拜的。如经上所记、『百姓坐下吃喝、起来玩耍。』  
10:8 我们也不要行奸淫、像他们有人行的、一天就倒毙了二万三千人。  
10:9 也不要试探主、〔主有古卷作基督〕像他们有人试探的、就被蛇所灭。  
10:10 你们也不要发怨言、像他们有发怨言的、就被灭命的所灭。  

10:11 他们遭遇这些事、都要作为鉴戒。并且写在经上、正是警戒我们这末世的人。  
10:12 所以自己以为站得稳的、须要谨慎、免得跌倒。  
10:13 你们所遇见的试探、无非是人所能受的、　神是信实的、必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候、总要给你们开一条出路、叫你们能忍受得住。  
10:14 我所亲爱的弟兄阿、你们要逃避拜偶像的事。  
10:15 我好像对明白人说的、你们要审察我的话。  

10:16 我们所祝福的杯、岂不是同领基督的血么。我们所擘开的饼、岂不是同领基督的身体么。  
10:17 我们虽多、仍是一个饼、一个身体。因为我们都是分受这一个饼。  
10:18 你们看属肉体的以色列人。那吃祭物的、岂不是在祭坛上有分么。  
10:19 我是怎么说呢。岂是说祭偶像之物算得甚么呢。或说偶像算得甚么呢。  
10:20 我乃是说、外邦人所献的祭、是祭鬼、不是祭　神。我不愿意你们与鬼相交。  

10:21 你们不能喝主的杯、又喝鬼的杯。不能吃主的筵席、又吃鬼的筵席。  
10:22 我们可惹主的愤恨么。我们比他还有能力么。  
10:23 凡事都可行。但不都有益处。凡事都可行。但不都造就人。  
10:24 无论何人、不要求自己的益处、乃要求别人的益处。  
10:25 凡市上所卖的、你们只管吃、不要为良心的缘故问甚么话。  

10:26 因为地和其中所充满的、都属乎主。  
10:27 倘有一个不信的人请你们赴席、你们若愿意去、凡摆在你们面前的、只管吃、不要为良心的缘故问甚么话。  
10:28 若有人对你们说、这是献过祭的物、就要为那告诉你们的人、并为良心的缘故、不吃。  
10:29 我说的良心、不是你的、乃是他的。我这自由、为甚么被别人的良心论断呢。  
10:30 我若谢恩而吃、为甚么因我谢恩的物被人毁谤呢。  

10:31 所以你们或吃或喝、无论作甚么、都要为荣耀　神而行。  
10:32 不拘是犹太人、是希利尼人、是　神的教会、你们都不要使他跌倒。  
10:33 就好像我凡事都叫众人喜欢、不求自己的益处、只求众人的益处、叫他们得救。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 11章  

11:1 你们该效法我、像我效法基督一样。  
11:2 我称赞你们、因你们凡事记念我、又坚守我所传给你们的。  
11:3 我愿意你们知道、基督是各人的头。男人是女人的头、　神是基督的头。  
11:4 凡男人祷告或是讲道、〔讲道或作说预言下同〕若蒙着头、就羞辱自己的头。  
11:5 凡女人祷告或是讲道、若不蒙着头、就羞辱自己的头。因为这就如同剃了头发一样。  

11:6 女人若不蒙着头、就该剪了头发。女人若以剪发剃发为羞愧、就该蒙着头。  
11:7 男人本不该蒙着头、因为他是　神的形像和荣耀、但女人是男人的荣耀。  
11:8 起初、男人不是由女人而出。女人乃是由男人而出。  
11:9 并且男人不是为女人造的。女人乃是为男人造的。  
11:10 因此、女人为天使的缘故、应当在头上有服权柄的记号。  

11:11 然而照主的安排、女也不是无男、男也不是无女。  
11:12 因为女人原是由男人而出、男人也是由女人而出。但万有都是出乎　神。  
11:13 你们自己审察、女人祷告　神、不蒙着头、是合宜的么。  
11:14 你们的本性不也指示你们、男人若有长头发、便是他的羞辱么。  
11:15 但女人有长头发、乃是他的荣耀。因为这头发是给他作盖头的。  

11:16 若有人想要辩驳、我们却没有这样的规矩、　神的众教会也是没有的。  
11:17 我现今吩咐你们的话、不是称赞你们。因为你们聚会不是受益、乃是招损。  
11:18 第一、我听说你们聚会的时候、彼此分门别类。我也稍微的信这话。  
11:19 在你们中间不免有分门结党的事、好叫那些有经验的人、显明出来。  
11:20 你们聚会的时候、算不得吃主的晚餐。  

11:21 因为吃的时候、各人先吃自己的饭、甚至这个饥饿、那个酒醉。  
11:22 你们要吃喝、难道没有家么。还是藐视　神的教会、叫那没有的羞愧呢。我向你们可怎么说呢。可因此称赞你们么。我不称赞。  
11:23 我当日传给你们的、原是从主领受的、就是主耶稣被卖的那一夜、拿起饼来、  
11:24 祝谢了、就擘开、说、这是我的身体、为你们舍的。〔舍有古卷作擘开〕你们应当如此行、为的是记念我。  
11:25 饭后、也照样拿起杯来、说、这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候、要如此行、为的是记念我。  

11:26 你们每逢吃这饼、喝这杯、是表明主的死、直等到他来。  
11:27 所以无论何人、不按理吃主的饼、喝主的杯、就是干犯主的身主的血了。  
11:28 人应当自己省察、然后吃这饼、喝这杯。  
11:29 因为人吃喝、若不分辨是主的身体、就是吃喝自己的罪了。  
11:30 因此、在你们中间有好些软弱的、与患病的、死的也不少。〔死原文作睡〕  

11:31 我们若是先分辨自己、就不至于受审。  
11:32 我们受审的时候、乃是被主惩治。免得我们和世人一同定罪。  
11:33 所以我弟兄们、你们聚会吃的时候、要彼此等待。  
11:34 若有人饥饿、可以在家里先吃。免得你们聚会自己取罪。其余的事、我来的时候再安排。

哥林多前书 12章  

12:1 弟兄们、论到属灵的恩赐、我不愿意你们不明白。  
12:2 你们作外邦人的时候、随事被牵引受迷惑、去服事那哑巴偶像。这是你们知道的。  
12:3 所以我告诉你们、被　神的灵感动的、没有说耶稣是可咒诅的。若不是被圣灵感动的、也没有能说耶稣是主的。  
12:4 恩赐原有分别、圣灵却是一位。  
12:5 职事也有分别、主却是一位。  

12:6 功用也有分别、　神却是一位、在众人里面运行一切的事。  
12:7 圣灵显在各人身上、是叫人得益处。  
12:8 这人蒙圣灵赐他智慧的言语。那人也蒙这位圣灵赐他知识的言语。  
12:9 又有一人蒙这位圣灵赐他信心。还有一人蒙这位圣灵赐他医病的恩赐。  
12:10 又叫一人能行异能。又叫一人能作先知。又叫一人能辨别诸灵。又叫一人能说方言。又叫一人能翻方言。  

12:11 这一切都是这位圣灵所运行、随己意分给各人的。  
12:12 就如身子是一个、却有许多肢体、而且肢体虽多、仍是一个身子。基督也是这样。  
12:13 我们不拘是犹太人、是希利尼人、是为奴的、是自主的、都从一位圣灵受洗、成了一个身体。饮于一位圣灵。  
12:14 身子原不是一个肢体、乃是许多肢体。  
12:15 设若脚说、我不是手、所以不属乎身子。他不能因此就不属乎身子。  

12:16 设若耳说、我不是眼、所以不属乎身子。他也不能因此就不属乎身子。  
12:17 若全身是眼、从那里听声呢。若全身是耳、从那里闻味呢。  
12:18 但如今　神随自己的意思、把肢体俱各安排在身上了。  
12:19 若都是一个肢体、身子在哪里呢。  
12:20 但如今肢体是多的、身子却是一个。  

12:21 眼不能对手说、我用不着你。头也不能对脚说、我用不着你。  
12:22 不但如此、身上肢体人以为软弱的、更是不可少的。  
12:23 身上肢体、我们看为不体面的、越发给他加上体面。不俊美的、越发得着俊美。  
12:24 我们俊美的肢体、自然用不着装饰。但　神配搭这身子、把加倍的体面给那有缺欠的肢体。  
12:25 免得身上分门别类。总要肢体彼此相顾。  

12:26 若一个肢体受苦、所有的肢体就一同受苦。若一个肢体得荣耀、所有的肢体就一同快乐。  
12:27 你们就是基督的身子、并且各自作肢体。  
12:28 　神在教会所设立的、第一是使徒。第二是先知。第三是教师。其次是行异能的。再次是得恩赐医病的。帮助人的。治理事的。说方言的。  
12:29 岂都是使徒么。岂都是先知么。岂都是教师么。岂都是行异能的么。  
12:30 岂都是得恩赐医病的么。岂都是说方言的么。岂都是翻方言的么。  

12:31 你们要切切的求那更大的恩赐、我现今把最妙的道指示你们。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 13章  

13:1 我若能说万人的方言、并天使的话语、却没有爱、我就成了鸣的锣、响的钹一般。  
13:2 我若有先知讲道之能、也明白各样的奥秘、各样的知识。而且有全备的信、叫我能够移山、却没有爱、我就算不得甚么。  
13:3 我若将所有的赒济穷人、又舍己身叫人焚烧、却没有爱、仍然与我无益。  
13:4 爱是恒久忍耐、又有恩慈。爱是不嫉妒。爱是不自夸。不张狂。  
13:5 不作害羞的事。不求自己的益处。不轻易发怒。不计算人的恶。  

13:6 不喜欢不义。只喜欢真理。  
13:7 凡事包容。凡事相信。凡事盼望。凡事忍耐。  
13:8 爱是永不止息。先知讲道之能、终必归于无有。说方言之能、终必停止、知识也终必归于无有。  
13:9 我们现在所知道的有限、先知所讲的也有限。  
13:10 等那完全的来到、这有限的必归于无有了。  

13:11 我作孩子的时候、话语像孩子、心思像孩子、意念像孩子。既成了人、就把孩子的事丢弃了。  
13:12 我们如今彷彿对着镜子观看、模糊不清。〔模糊不清原文作如同猜谜〕到那时、就要面对面了。我如今所知道的有限。到那时就全知道、如同主知道我一样。  
13:13 如今常存的有信、有望、有爱、这三样、其中最大的是爱。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 14章  

14:1 你们要追求爱、也要切慕属灵的恩赐、其中更要羡慕的、是作先知讲道。〔原文作是说预言下同〕  
14:2 那说方言的、原不是对人说、乃是对　神说。因为没有人听出来。然而他在心灵里、却是讲说各样的奥秘。  
14:3 但作先知讲道的、是对人说、要造就、安慰、劝勉人。  
14:4 说方言的、是造就自己。作先知讲道的、乃是造就教会。  
14:5 我愿意你们都说方言。更愿意你们作先知讲道。因为说方言的、若不翻出来、使教会被造就、那作先知讲道的、就比他强了。  

14:6 弟兄们、我到你们那里去、若只说方言、不用启示、或知识、或预言、或教训、给你们讲解、我与你们有甚么益处呢。  
14:7 就是那有声无气的物、或箫、或琴、若发出来的声音、没有分别、怎能知道所吹所弹的是甚么呢。  
14:8 若吹无定的号声、谁能预备打仗呢。  
14:9 你们也是如此、舌头若不说容易明白的话、怎能知道所说的是甚么呢。这就是向空说话了。  
14:10 世上的声音、或者甚多、却没有一样是无意思的。  

14:11 我若不明白那声音的意思、这说话的人必以我为化外之人、我也以他为化外之人。  
14:12 你们也是如此。既是切慕属灵的恩赐、就当求多得造就教会的恩赐。  
14:13 所以那说方言的、就当求着能翻出来。  
14:14 我若用方言祷告、是我的灵祷告。但我的悟性没有果效。  
14:15 这却怎么样呢。我要用灵祷告、也要用悟性祷告。我要用灵歌唱、也要用悟性歌唱。  

14:16 不然、你用灵祝谢、那在座不通方言的人、既然不明白你的话、怎能在你感谢的时候说阿们呢。  
14:17 你感谢的固然是好、无奈不能造就别人。  
14:18 我感谢　神、我说方言比你们众人还多。  
14:19 但在教会中、宁可用悟性说五句教导人的话、强如说万句方言。  
14:20 弟兄们、在心志上不要作小孩子。然而在恶事上要作婴孩。在心志上总要作大人。  

14:21 律法上记着、『主说、我要用外邦人的舌头、和外邦人的嘴唇、向这百姓说话。虽然如此、他们还是不听从我。』  
14:22 这样看来、说方言、不是为信的人作证据、乃是为不信的人。作先知讲道、不是为不信的人作证据、乃是为信的人。  
14:23 所以全教会聚在一处的时候、若都说方言、偶然有不通方言的、或是不信的人进来、岂不说你们癫狂了么。  
14:24 若都作先知讲道、偶然有不信的、或是不通方言的人进来、就被众人劝醒、被众人审明。  
14:25 他心里的隐情显露出来、就必将脸伏地、敬拜　神、说　神真是在你们中间了。  

14:26 弟兄们、这却怎么样呢。你们聚会的时候、各人或有诗歌、或有教训、或有启示、或有方言、或有翻出来的话。凡事都当造就人。  
14:27 若有说方言的、只好两个人、至多三个人、且要轮流着说、也要一个人翻出来。  
14:28 若没有人翻、就当在会中闭口。只对自己和　神说、就是了。  
14:29 至于作先知讲道的、只好两个人、或是三个人、其余的就当慎思明辨。  
14:30 若旁边坐着的得了启示、那先说话的就当闭口不言。  

14:31 因为你们都可以一个一个的作先知讲道、叫众人学道理。叫众人得劝勉。  
14:32 先知的灵、原是顺服先知的。  
14:33 因为　神不是叫人混乱、乃是叫人安静。  
14:34 妇女在会中要闭口不言、像在圣徒的众教会一样。因为不准他们说话。他们总要顺服、正如律法所说的。  
14:35 他们若要学甚么、可以在家里问自己的丈夫。因为妇女在会中说话原是可耻的。  

14:36 　神的道理、岂是从你们出来么。岂是单临到你们么。  
14:37 若有人以为自己是先知、或是属灵的、就该知道、我所写给你们的是主的命令。  
14:38 若有不知道的、就由他不知道吧。  
14:39 所以我弟兄们、你们要切慕作先知讲道、也不要禁止说方言。  
14:40 凡事都要规规矩矩的按着次序行。  


------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 15章  

15:1 弟兄们、我如今把先前所传给你们的福音、告诉你们知道、这福音你们也领受了、又靠着站立得住。  
15:2 并且你们若不是徒然相信、能以持守我所传给你们的、就必因这福音得救。  
15:3 我当日所领受又传给你们的、第一、就是基督照圣经所说、为我们的罪死了。  
15:4 而且埋葬了。又照圣经所说、第三天复活了。  
15:5 并且显给矶法看。然后显给十二使徒看。  

15:6 后来一时显给五百多弟兄看、其中一大半到如今还在、却也有已经睡了的。  
15:7 以后显给雅各看。再显给众使徒看。  
15:8 末了也显给我看。我如同未到产期而生的人一般。  
15:9 我原是使徒中最小的、不配称为使徒、因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。  
15:10 然而我今日成了何等人、是蒙　神的恩才成的。并且他所赐我的恩、不是徒然的。我比众使徒格外劳苦。这原不是我、乃是　神的恩与我同在。  

15:11 不拘是我是众使徒、我们如此传、你们也如此信了。  
15:12 既传基督是从死里复活了、怎么在你们中间、有人说没有死人复活的事呢。  
15:13 若没有死人复活的事、基督也就没有复活了。  
15:14 若基督没有复活、我们所传的便是枉然、你们所信的也是枉然。  
15:15 并且明显我们是为　神妄作见证的。因我们见证　神是叫基督复活了。若死人真不复活、　神也就没有叫基督复活了。  

15:16 因为死人若不复活、基督也就没有复活了。  
15:17 基督若没有复活、你们的信便是徒然。你们仍在罪里。  
15:18 就是在基督里睡了的人也灭亡了。  
15:19 我们若靠基督、只在今生有指望、就算比众人更可怜。  
15:20 但基督已经从死里复活、成为睡了之人初熟的果子。  

15:21 死既是因一人而来、死人复活也是因一人而来。  
15:22 在亚当里众人都死了。照样、在基督里众人也都要复活。  
15:23 但各人是按着自己的次序复活。初熟的果子是基督。以后在他来的时候、是那些属基督的。  
15:24 再后末期到了、那时、基督既将一切执政的、掌权的、有能的、都毁灭了、就把国交与父　神。  
15:25 因为基督必要作王、等　神把一切仇敌、都放在他的脚下。  

15:26 尽末了所毁灭的仇敌、就是死。  
15:27 因为经上说、『　神叫万物都服在他的脚下。』既说万物都服了他、明显那叫万物服他的不在其内了。  
15:28 万物既服了他、那时、子也要自己服那叫万物服他的、叫　神在万物之上、为万物之主。  
15:29 不然、那些为死人受洗的、将来怎样呢。若死人总不复活、因何为他们受洗呢。  
15:30 我们又因何时刻冒险呢。  

15:31 弟兄们、我在我主基督耶稣里、指着你们所夸的口、极力的说、我是天天冒死。  
15:32 我若当日像寻常人、在以弗所同野兽战斗、那于我有甚么益处呢。若死人不复活、我们就吃吃喝喝吧。因为明天要死了。  
15:33 你们不要自欺。滥交是败坏善行。  
15:34 你们要醒悟为善、不要犯罪。因为有人不认识　神。我说这话、是要叫你们羞愧。  
15:35 或有人问、死人怎样复活。带着甚么身体来呢。  

15:36 无知的人哪、你所种的、若不死就不能生。  
15:37 并且你所种的、不是那将来的形体、不过是子粒、即如麦子、或是别样的谷。  
15:38 但　神随自己的意思、给他一个形体、并叫各等子粒、各有自己的形体。  
15:39 凡肉体各有不同。人是一样、兽又是一样、鸟又是一样、鱼又是一样。  
15:40 有天上的形体、也有地上的形体。但天上形体的荣光是一样、地上形体的荣光又是一样。  

15:41 日有日的荣光、月有月的荣光、星有星的荣光。这星和那星的荣光、也有分别。  
15:42 死人复活也是这样。所种的是必朽坏的、复活的是不朽坏的。  
15:43 所种的是羞辱的、复活的是荣耀的。所种的是软弱的、复活的是强壮的。  
15:44 所种的是血气的身体、复活的是灵性的身体。若有血气的身体、也必有灵性的身体。  
15:45 经上也是这样记着说、『首先的人亚当、成了有灵的活人。』〔灵或作血气〕末后的亚当、成了叫人活的灵。  

15:46 但属灵的不在先、属血气的在先。以后才有属灵的。  
15:47 头一个人是出于地、乃属土。第二个人是出于天。  
15:48 那属土的怎样、凡属土的也就怎样。属天的怎样、凡属天的也就怎样。  
15:49 我们既有属土的形状、将来也必有属天的形状。  
15:50 弟兄们、我告诉你们说、血肉之体、不能承受　神的国。必朽坏的、不能承受不朽坏的。  

15:51 我如今把一件奥秘的事告诉你们。我们不是都要睡觉、乃是都要改变、  
15:52 就在一霎时、眨眼之间、号筒末次吹响的时候。因号筒要响、死人要复活成为不朽坏的、我们也要改变。  
15:53 这必朽坏的、总要变成不朽坏的。〔变成原文作穿下同〕这必死的、总要变成不死的。  
15:54 这必朽坏的、既变成不朽坏的。这必死的、既变成不死的。那时经上所记、死被得胜吞灭的话就应验了。  
15:55 死阿、你得胜的权势在那里。死阿、你的毒钩在那里。  

15:56 死的毒钩就是罪。罪的权势就是律法。  
15:57 感谢　神、使我们借着我们的主耶稣基督得胜。  
15:58 所以我亲爱的弟兄们、你们务要坚固不可摇动、常常竭力多作主工、因为知道你们的劳苦、在主里面不是徒然的。  

------------------------------------------

哥林多前书 16章  

16:1 论到为圣徒捐钱、我从前怎样吩咐加拉太的众教会、你们也当怎样行。  
16:2 每逢七日的第一日、各人要照自己的进项抽出来留着。免得我来的时候现凑。  
16:3 及至我来到了、你们写信举荐谁、我就打发他们、把你们的捐资送到耶路撒冷去。  
16:4 若我也该去、他们可以和我同去。  
16:5 我要从马其顿经过。既经过了、就要到你们那里去。  

16:6 或者和你们同住几时、或者也过冬。无论我往那里去、你们就可以给我送行。  
16:7 我如今不愿意路过见你们。主若许我、我就指望和你们同住几时。  
16:8 但我要仍旧住在以弗所、直等到五旬节。  
16:9 因为有宽大又有功效的门、为我开了、并且反对的人也多。  
16:10 若是提摩太来到、你们要留心、叫他在你们那里无所惧怕。因为他劳力作主的工、像我一样。  

16:11 所以无论谁、都不可藐视他。只要送他平安前行、叫他到我这里来。因我指望他和弟兄们同来。  
16:12 至于兄弟亚波罗、我再三的劝他、同弟兄们到你们那里去。但这时他决不愿意去。几时有了机会他必去。  
16:13 你们务要儆醒、在真道上站立得稳、要作大丈夫、要刚强。  
16:14 凡你们所作的、都要凭爱心而作。  
16:15 弟兄们、你们晓得司提反一家、是亚该亚初结的果子。并且他们专以服事圣徒为念。  

16:16 我劝你们顺服这样的人、并一切同工同劳的人。  
16:17 司提反、和福徒拿都、并亚该古、到这里来、我很喜欢。因为你们待我有不及之处、他们补上了。  
16:18 他们叫我和你们心里都快活。这样的人、你们务要敬重。  
16:19 亚西亚的众教会问你们安。亚居拉和百基拉、并在他们家里的教会、因主多多的问你们安。  
16:20 众弟兄都问你们安。你们要亲嘴问安、彼此务要圣洁。  

16:21 我保罗亲笔问安。  
16:22 若有人不爱主、这人可诅可咒。主必要来。  
16:23 愿主耶稣基督的恩、常与你们众人同在。  
16:24 我在基督耶稣里的爱、与你们众人同在。阿们。
