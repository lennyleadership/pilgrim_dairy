2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.  
2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  
2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.  
2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:  
2:5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.  

2:6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:  
2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:  
2:8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  
2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.  
2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  

2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  
2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  
2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  
2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.  

2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

2:1 弟兄们、从前我到你们那里去、并没有用高言大智对你们宣传　神的奥秘。  
2:2 因为我曾定了主意、在你们中间不知道别的、只知道耶稣基督、并他钉十字架。  
2:3 我在你们那里、又软弱、又惧怕、又甚战兢。  
2:4 我说的话讲的道、不是用智慧委婉的言语、乃是用圣灵和大能的明证。  
2:5 叫你们的信不在乎人的智慧、只在乎　神的大能。  

2:6 然而在完全的人中、我们也讲智慧。  但不是这世上的智慧、也不是这世上有权有位将要败亡之人的智慧。  
2:7 我们讲的、乃是从前所隐藏、　神奥秘的智慧、就是　神在万世以前、预定使我们得荣耀的。  
2:8 这智慧世上有权有位的人没有一个知道的。  他们若知道、就不把荣耀的主钉在十字架上了。  
2:9 如经上所记、『　神为爱他的人所预备的、是眼睛未曾看见、耳朵未曾听见、人心也未曾想到的。』
2:10 只有　神借着圣灵向我们显明了。  因为圣灵参透万事、就是　神深奥的事也参透了。  

2:11 除了在人里头的灵、谁知道人的事。  像这样、除了　神的灵、也没有人知道　神的事。  
2:12 我们所领受的、并不是世上的灵、乃是从　神来的灵、叫我们能知道　神开恩赐给我们的事。  
2:13 并且我们讲说这些事、不是用人智慧所指教的言语、乃是用圣灵所指教的言语、将属灵的话、解释属灵的事。  〔或作将属灵的事讲与属灵的人〕
2:14 然而属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事、反倒以为愚拙。  并且不能知道、因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。  
2:15 属灵的人能看透万事、却没有一人能看透了他。  

2:16 谁曾知道主的心去教导他呢。但我们是有基督的心了。

<h2>"Not by Might nor by Power" | My Utmost For His Highest</h2>

> My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power… 
> — 1 Corinthians 2:4


If in preaching the gospel you substitute your knowledge of the way of salvation for confidence in the power of the gospel, you hinder people from getting to reality. Take care to see while you proclaim your knowledge of the way of salvation, that you yourself are rooted and grounded by faith in God. Never rely on the clearness of your presentation, but as you give your explanation make sure that you are relying on the Holy Spirit. Rely on the certainty of God’s redemptive power, and He will create His own life in people.  

Once you are rooted in reality, nothing can shake you. If your faith is in experiences, anything that happens is likely to upset that faith. But nothing can ever change God or the reality of redemption. Base your faith on that, and you are as eternally secure as God Himself. Once you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you will never be moved again. That is the meaning of sanctification. God disapproves of our human efforts to cling to the concept that sanctification is merely an experience, while forgetting that even our sanctification must also be sanctified (see John 17:19). I must deliberately give my sanctified life to God for His service, so that He can use me as His hands and His feet.

<h2>WISDOM FROM OSWALD CHAMBERS<</h2>  

The emphasis to-day is placed on the furtherance of an organization; the note is, “We must keep this thing going.” If we are in God’s order the thing will go; if we are not in His order, it won’t.  Conformed to His Image, 357 R

<h2>Lenny's meditation</h2>
Brother L: Believers are eager to experience miraclous experience, and yet forget to connect it to the life fruit.  Today's devotion helped me make such connection.
