Genesis

22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.  
22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.  <a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a>      
22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.  
22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.  
22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.  

22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.  
22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  
22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.  
22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  
22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.  

22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.  
22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  
22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.  
22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.  
22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,  

22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:  
22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies:  
22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  
22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.  <a id="2_ref" href = "#2">[2]</a>   
22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor:  

22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,  
22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.  
22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.  
22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

[Genesis 22:2] Take now thy son . . and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.  
Character determines how a man interprets God’s will (cf. Psalm 18:25-26).   
If we keep true to God, God will take us through an ordeal which will bring us out into a better knowledge of Himself.  
Don’t ask God to test you. Never declare as Peter did – "I will do anything, I will go to death with Thee." Abraham did not make any such declaration, he remained true to God, and God purified his faith.

<p id="2">[2]   
By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing…I will bless you… — Genesis 22:16-17   

Abraham, at this point, has reached where he is in touch with the very nature of God. He now understands the reality of God.  

My goal is God Himself…  

At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.  

“At any cost…by any road” means submitting to God’s way of bringing us to the goal.  

There is no possibility of questioning God when He speaks, if <u class = "red">He speaks to His own nature in me</u>. Prompt obedience is the only result. When Jesus says, “Come,” I simply come; when He says, “Let go,” I let go; when He says, “Trust God in this matter,” I trust. This work of obedience is the evidence that <u class = "red">the nature of God is in me</u>.  

God’s revelation of Himself to me is influenced by my character, not by God’s character.  

’Tis because I am ordinary,  
Thy ways so often look ordinary to me.  

It is through the discipline of obedience that I get to the place where Abraham was and I see who God is. God will never be real to me until I come face to face with Him in Jesus Christ. Then I will know and can boldly proclaim, “In all the world, my God, there is none but Thee, there is none but Thee.”  

The promises of God are of no value to us until, through obedience, we come to understand the nature of God. We may read some things in the Bible every day for a year and they may mean nothing to us. Then, because we have been obedient to God in some small detail, we suddenly see what God means and His nature is instantly opened up to us. “All the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen…” (2 Corinthians 1:20). Our “Yes” must be born of obedience; when by obedience we ratify a promise of God by saying, “Amen,” or, “So be it.” That promise becomes ours.

《竭诚为主》11月17日  

永恒的目标  

你既行了这事……我便指着自己起誓说，论福，我必赐大福给你……。（创二十二15-19）  

亚伯拉罕接触到神的本性，他如今明白神的真实。[神自己，是我的目标，不论代价，亲爱的主，不论何方。]  

不论代价，不论何方，就是自己没有任何可选择的，只求神带领到达目标。

若神对我里面的性情说话，我根本不会质疑发问，只会马上顺服。耶稣说：[来]，我就来；他说：[放手]，我就放手；他说：[这事要信靠神]，我就信靠。整个过程证明了神的性情在我里面。  

神对我启示他自己，决定于我的品性，而不在于神的品性。[由于我是卑贱的，以致你的道路，在我看来也往往是卑贱的。]在顺服的操练下，我来到亚伯拉罕曾到之处，认识神是谁。我没有在主耶稣里与神面对面以前，没有遇到一位真的神，但如今我知道[在整个世界中，除你以外，我再没有谁]。

神的应许对我们毫无价值，除非我们藉顺服明白神的本性。圣经的话可以念过三百六十五次，而仍对我们毫无意义。但突然我们却看出神的意思，因为在某些事上我们顺服神，他的性情立刻向我们开敞了。[神的应许不论有多少，在基督都是是的，所以藉着他也是实在的。]这个[是的]，必须从顺服中出来；我们若藉着生命中的顺服对应许说[阿们]，那应许就属于我们。 

祈祷◆主啊，求你唤醒我，以致我那必死的身体，能真正成为一个顺服圣灵的仆人。 <a href="#2_ref">&#8617;</a></p>
