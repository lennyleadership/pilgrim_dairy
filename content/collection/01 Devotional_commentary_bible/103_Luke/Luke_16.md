Book of Luke

16:1 耶稣又对门徒说、有一个财主的管家。别人向他主人告他浪费主人的财物。  
16:2 主人叫他来、对他说、我听见你这事怎么样呢。把你所经管的交代明白。因你不能再作我的管家。  
16:3 那管家心里说、主人辞我、不用我再作管家、我将来作甚么。锄地呢、无力。讨饭呢、怕羞。  
16:4 我知道怎么行、好叫人在我不作管家之后、接我到他们家里去。  
16:5 于是把欠他主人债的、一个一个的叫了来、问头一个说、你欠我主人多少。  

16:6 他说、一百篓油。〔每篓约五十斤〕管家说、拿你的帐快坐下写五十。  
16:7 又问一个说、你欠多少。他说、一百石麦子。管家说、拿你的帐写八十。  
16:8 主人就夸奖这不义的管家作事聪明。因为今世之子、在世事之上、较比光明之子、更加聪明。  
16:9 我又告诉你们、要借着那不义的钱财、结交朋友。到了钱财无用的时候、他们可以接你们到永存的帐幕里去。  
16:10 人在最小的事上忠心、在大事上也忠心。在最小的事上不义、在大事上也不义。  

16:11 倘若你们在不义的钱财上不忠心、谁还把那真实的钱财托付你们呢。  
16:12 倘若你们在别人的东西上不忠心、谁还把你们自己的东西给你们呢。  
16:13 一个仆人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个、就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉　神、又事奉玛门。  
16:14 法利赛人是贪爱钱财的、他们听见这一切话、就嗤笑耶稣。[1 Timothy 6:9-10, Matthew 19:24]  
16:15 耶稣对他们说、你们是在人面前自称为义的。你们的心、　神却知道。因为人所尊贵的是　神看为可憎恶的。  

16:16 律法和先知、到约翰为止。从此　神国的福音传开了、人人努力要进去。  
16:17 天地废去、较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。  
16:18 凡休妻另娶的、就是犯奸淫。娶被休之妻的、也是犯奸淫。  
16:19 有一个财主、穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服、天天奢华宴乐。  
16:20 又有一个讨饭的、名叫拉撒路、浑身生疮、被人放在财主门口、

16:21 要得财主桌子上掉下来的零碎充饥。并且狗来餂他的疮。  
16:22 后来那讨饭的死了、被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了、并且埋葬了。  
16:23 他在阴间受痛苦、举目远远的望见亚伯拉罕、又望见拉撒路在他怀里。  
16:24 就喊着说、我祖亚伯拉罕哪、可怜我吧、打发拉撒路来、用指头尖蘸点水、凉凉我的舌头。因为我在这火焰里、极其痛苦。  
16:25 亚伯拉罕说、儿阿、你该回想你生前享过福、拉撒路也受过苦。如今他在这里得安慰、你倒受痛苦。  

16:26 不但这样、并且在你我之间、有深渊限定、以致人要从这边过到你们那边、是不能的、要从那边过到我们这边、也是不能的。  
16:27 财主说、我祖阿、既是这样、求你打发拉撒路到我父家去。  
16:28 因为我还有五个弟兄。他可以对他们作见证、免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。  
16:29 亚伯拉罕说、他们有摩西和先知的话、可以听从。  
16:30 他说、我祖亚伯拉罕哪、不是的。若有一个从死里复活的、到他们那里去的、他们必要悔改。  

16:31 亚伯拉罕说、若不听从摩西和先知的话、就是有一个从死里复活的、他们也是不听劝。

[2022.10.05 LBC]  
The parable of the shrewd manager told us to use our intelligence to prepare ahead.  
We should think ahead using time, money for heaven toward the good end.  
Sister C.: Jesus poked Pharasee.  
Sin to avoid: put hope, security in money.  
Promise to claim: treasure in heaven.  
Example to follow:   
Command to obey: use possession to help others.  
Knowledge of God: God knows our heart.  

Shrewd: Be smart in the cunning way.  

Brother Winston: achieve outcome by all means.

[2022.10.12 LBC]  
Serve money.  Life runs after money.  See money as God. 人为财死，鸟为食亡。  

There is no second chance for the dead to hear the gospel.

**Question: "What is the meaning of the Parable of the Unjust Steward (Luke 16:1-13)?"**  

Answer: The Parable of the Unjust Steward can be found in Luke 16:1–13. The text can be broken down into two parts: the parable (verses 1–8) and the application (verses 9–13). Luke 16:1 identifies that Jesus is speaking to His disciples, but there is a suggestion that His audience is mixed—disciples and Pharisees. Luke 16:14 states that the Pharisees “heard all these things and ridiculed [Jesus].” We also see in verse 1 that Jesus “also” said to the disciples; the “also” would suggest that this parable is connected to the previous three in Luke 15 and that the audience was a mixed crowd of disciples and Pharisees.

It is important to know to whom Jesus is addressing this parable. The parable is for the benefit of the disciples, but there is also a not-so-subtle critique of the Pharisees, as was evident in Luke 15. Verse 14 is Luke’s commentary on the motivation of the Pharisees, and in verse 15 we see our Lord condemn their motives. And what was the Pharisees’ motivation? They were those who were “lovers of money” and who “justify themselves before men” and who exalted that which was an “abomination before God.”

With that as a backdrop, let’s look at the parable. It’s a fairly simple, if somewhat unorthodox, parable from Jesus. The story is simple, but the setting is unusual. In most of Jesus’ parables, the protagonist is either representative of God, Christ, or some other positive character. In this parable the characters are all wicked—the steward and the man whose possessions he manages are both unsavory characters. This should alert us to the fact that Jesus is not exhorting us to emulate the behavior of the characters but is trying to expound on a larger principle.

The parable begins with a rich man calling his steward before him to inform him that he will be relieving him of his duties for mismanaging his master’s resources. A steward is a person who manages the resources of another. The steward had authority over all of the master’s resources and could transact business in his name. This requires the utmost level of trust in the steward. Now, it may not be apparent at this point in the parable (but is made more evident later on), but the master is probably not aware of the steward’s dishonesty. The steward is being released for apparent mismanagement, not fraud. This explains why he is able to conduct a few more transactions before he is released and why he is not immediately tossed out on the street or executed.

The steward, realizing that he will soon be without a job, makes some shrewd deals behind his master’s back by reducing the debt owed by several of the master’s debtors in exchange for shelter when he is eventually put out. When the master becomes aware of what the wicked servant had done, he commends him for his “shrewdness.”

In His application of the story in the remaining verses, Jesus begins by saying, “For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light” (Luke 16:8). Jesus is drawing a contrast between the “sons of the world” (i.e., unbelievers) and the “sons of light” (believers). Unbelievers are wiser in the things of this world than believers are about the things of the world to come. The unjust steward, once he knew he was about to be put out, maneuvered to collect some quick cash, cheat his master (who more than likely was cheating his customers), and make friends of his master’s debtors—who would then be obligated to care for him once he lost his job.

What does this have to do with believers being wise about the life to come? Let’s look at verse 9: “And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.” Jesus is encouraging His followers to be generous with their wealth in this life so that in the life to come their new friends will receive them “into eternal dwellings.” This is similar to Jesus’ teaching on wealth in the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus exhorts His followers to lay up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19–21).

The term unrighteous (or worldly) wealth seems to strike readers the wrong way. But Jesus is not saying that believers should gain wealth unrighteously and then be generous with it. “Unrighteous” in reference to wealth can refer to 1) the means in acquiring wealth; 2) the way in which one desires to use the wealth; or 3) the corrupting influence wealth can have that often leads people to commit unrighteous acts. Given the way in which Jesus employs the term, the third explanation seems the most likely. Wealth is not inherently evil, but the love of money can lead to all sorts of sin (1 Timothy 6:10).

So, the principle that Jesus is trying to convey is one of a just steward rather than an unjust one. The unjust steward saw his master’s resources as a means for his own personal enjoyment and advancement. Conversely, Jesus wants His followers to be just, righteous stewards. If we understand the principle that everything we own is a gift from God, then we realize that God is the owner of everything and that we are His stewards. As such, we are to use the Master’s resources to further the Master’s goals. In this specific case, we are to be generous with our wealth and use it for the benefit of others.

Jesus then goes on to expand in verses 10–13 the principle given in verse 9. If one is faithful in “little” (i.e., “unrighteous” wealth), then one will be faithful in much. Similarly, if one is dishonest in little, he will also be dishonest in much. If we can’t be faithful with earthly wealth, which isn’t even ours to begin with, then how can we be entrusted with “true riches”? The “true riches” here is referring to stewardship and responsibility in God’s kingdom along with all the accompanying heavenly rewards.

The climax of Jesus’ application is verse 13: “No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money” (see also Matthew 6:24). If God is our Master, then our wealth will be at His disposal. In other words, the faithful and just steward whose Master is God will employ that wealth in building up the kingdom of God.
