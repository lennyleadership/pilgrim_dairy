10:1 这事以后、主又设立七十个人、差遣他们两个两个的、在他前面往自己所要到的各城各地方去。  
10:2 就对他们说、要收的庄稼多、作工的人少。所以你们当求庄稼的主、打发工人出去收他的庄稼。  
10:3 你们去吧。我差你们出去、如同羊羔进入狼群。  
10:4 不要带钱囊、不要带口袋、不要带鞋。在路上也不要问人的安。  
10:5 无论进那一家、先要说、愿这一家平安。  

10:6 那里若有当得平安的人、〔当得平安的人原文作平安之子〕你们所求的平安就必临到那家、不然、就归与你们了。  
10:7 你们要住在那家、吃喝他们所供给的。因为工人得工价、是应当的。不要从这家搬到那家。  
10:8 无论进那一城、人若接待你们、给你们摆上甚么、你们就吃甚么。  
10:9 要医治那城里的病人、对他们说、　神的国临近你们了。  
10:10 无论进那一城、人若不接待你们、你们就到街上去、

10:11 说、就是你们城里的尘土、粘在我们的脚上、我们也当着你们擦去。虽然如此、你们该知道　神的国临近了。  
10:12 我告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛所受的、比那城还容易受呢。  
10:13 哥拉汛哪、你有祸了。伯赛大阿、你有祸了。因为在你们中间所行的异能、若行在推罗西顿、他们早已披麻蒙灰坐在地上悔改了。  
10:14 当审判的日子、推罗西顿所受的、比你们还容易受呢。  
10:15 迦百农阿、你已经升到天上。〔或作你将要升到天上么〕将来必推下阴间。  

10:16 又对门徒说、听从你们的、就是听从我、弃绝你们的、就是弃绝我、弃绝我的、就是弃绝那差我来的。  
10:17 那七十个人欢欢喜喜的回来说、主阿、因你的名、就是鬼也服了我们。  
10:18 耶稣对他们说、我曾看见撒但从天上坠落、像闪电一样。  
10:19 我已经给你们权柄、可以践踏蛇和蝎子、又胜过仇敌一切的能力、断没有甚么能害你们。  
10:20 然而不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜。要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。  

10:21 正当那时、耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐、说、父阿、天地的主、我感谢你、因为你将这些事、向聪明通达人就藏起来、向婴孩就显出来。父阿、是的、因为你的美意本是如此。  
10:22 一切所有的、都是我父交付我的。除了父、没有人知道子是谁。除了子和子所愿意指示的、没有人知道父是谁。  
10:23 耶稣转身暗暗的对门徒说。看见你们所看见的、那眼睛就有福了。  
10:24 我告诉你们、从前有许多先知和君王、要看你们所看的、却没有看见。要听你们所听的、却没有听见。  
10:25 有一个律法师、起来试探耶稣说、夫子、我该作甚么才可以承受永生。&nbsp; &nbsp; [^1]  

10:26 耶稣对他说、律法上写的是甚么。你念的是怎样呢。  
10:27 他回答说、『你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意、爱主你的　神。又要爱邻舍如同自己。』
10:28 耶稣说、你回答的是。你这样行、就必得永生。  
10:29 那人要显明自己有理、就对耶稣说、谁是我的邻舍呢。  
10:30 耶稣回答说、有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去、落在强盗手中、他们剥去他的衣裳、把他打个半死、就丢下他走了。  

10:31 偶然有一个祭司、从这条路下来。看见他就从那边过去了。  
10:32 又有一个利未人、来到这地方、看见他、也照样从那边过去了。  
10:33 惟有一个撒玛利亚人、行路来到那里。看见他就动了慈心、
10:34 上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处、包裹好了、扶他骑上自己的牲口、带到店里去照应他。  
10:35 第二天拿出二钱银子来、交给店主说、你且照应他。此外所费用的、我回来必还你。  

10:36 你想这三个人、那一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢。  
10:37 他说、是怜悯他的。耶稣说、你去照样行吧。  
10:38 他们走路的时候、耶稣进了一个村庄。有一个女人名叫马大、接他到自己家里。  
10:39 他有一个妹子名叫马利亚、在耶稣脚前坐着听他的道。  
10:40 马大伺候的事多、心里忙乱、就进前来说、主阿、我的妹子留下我一个人伺候、你不在意么。请吩咐他来帮助我。  

10:41 耶稣回答说、马大、马大、你为许多的事、思虑烦扰。  
10:42 但是不可少的只有一件。马利亚已经选择那上好的福分、是不能夺去的。  

[^1]: The verse of Luke 10:27 says this: Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself (KJV).  
The cross-reference of this verse can be found in Mat 22:35-40, Mark 12:28-34, Deut 6:4-5, and Duet 30:1-6.  However only this verse links the great commandment in law with the eternal life.  
<br />  
**What does "everylasting life" mean?**  
Does it mean a person who believes in Jesus will go to heaven after death? or something else?   
The strong number of life in Luke 10:25 is 2222.  
<br />  
The strong number 2222 appears in Romans ‬6:4.  It says this:  
(KJV) Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  
This verse tells me three things, 1) it is new; 2) we have this life once we believe in Him; 3) the life we have on earth will not be different from the life we have on the heaven.  The transformed life in every believer starts right now, and lasts forever.  We can enjoy the sweetness of such life right now, and don't have to wait until we go to the heaven.  I could deduct from it that if a person didn't have such life on earth, this person would not be saved, therefore this person would not go to the heaven; and that if a person claimed "be saved", the person would show such life right now.  
<br />  
The strong number 222 also appears in John 17:3. It says this:
‪(KJV) And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.  As brother K pointed it out that having eternal life is to know God in a personal relationship with Him. This is why when God saved us He made us His children, and not His servants. So that we can have a loving relationship with Him. God want a loving relationship with us. This is why He sent His Son to reconcile us to himself. This is why we as Christians are given the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18) to mend a broken relationship. In a broken relationship the children of Adam do not know how to love God. This is why the lawyer asked “what must I do” to inherit eternal life. The lawyer’s religion is one of gaining favour with God. Whereas God wants a restored loving relationship.  
<br />  
**Jesus is the only way**.  
‪Romans‬ 6:22-23 (KJV) says this,
22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.   
23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
They tell us Jesus is the way for a non-believer to have the everlasting life. 
<br />  
**Why did Jesus not point it out to the lawyer that He is the way?**  
The Baptist John described these Pharisees in Mat 3:7 as the generation of viper.  These Pharisees got a warning message from the Baptist John about repentance.  I assume the lawyer in Luke 10:25 would know of this warning message.  When the lawyer met Jesus, he did not take the opportunity of repentance, but 'tempting' Him.  Jesus did not repeat the warning message.  Did Jesus not give him an opportunity of salvation?  I wish the lawyer would get another opportunity.  
The contrary story is Paul's life.  Paul introduced himself in Philippians 3:4-6 (He was a Pharisee, and blamelss in the law).  Of course, he knew "love the Lord your God with all ...", but "persecuted Jesus" (Acts 9:4).  However when Paul met Jesus in a miracle, he called Him 'Lord'. Jesus selected him even though Paul was one of Pharisees (Acts 9:3).  
    Matthew ‬3:7 KJV 
    7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  
    Philippians ‬3:4-6 KJV  
    4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:  
    5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;  
    6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.    
    <br />  
    Acts ‬9:3 KJV  
    3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:  
<br />  
    What made difference between the lawyer and Paul for salvation?  Jesus 'selection'? or their attitudes/repent towards Jesus?  
<br />  
what does "love the Lord thy God with all my heart, my soul, my strength, my mind" have to do with the eternal life?    
When Jesus answered in Luke 10:28, He broke down the meaning of "eternal life" into two components, "life" which is the present life style, and "eternal".  
Jesus just addressed "life", but didn't address about "eternal".
