阿摩司书


<!--more-->

3:1 以色列人哪、你们全家是我从埃及地领上来的、当听耶和华攻击你们的话。  
3:2 在地上万族中、我只认识你们。因此、我必追讨你们的一切罪孽。[<a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "今天，我们和以色列人一样是被神「认识」的百姓，但这特殊的恩典却不允许被滥用；信徒并没有免受审判的特权，而是恩典越大、责任也越大，「因为多给谁，就向谁多取；多托谁，就向谁多要」（路十二48）。 &#010;  但并不是说人不被神「认识」，就不必受审判，「因为时候到了，审判要从神的家起首。若是先从我们起首，那不信从神福音的人将有何等的结局呢」（彼前四17）？">**注一**</a>] [^1]  
3:3 二人若不同心、岂能同行呢。  
3:4 狮子若非抓食、岂能在林中咆哮呢。少壮狮子若无所得、岂能从洞中发声呢。  
3:5 若没有机槛、雀鸟岂能陷在网罗里呢。网罗若无所得、岂能从地上翻起呢。  

3:6 城中若吹角、百姓岂不惊恐呢。灾祸若临到一城、岂非耶和华所降的么。  
3:7 主耶和华若不将奥秘指示他的仆人众先知、就一无所行。[<a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "神总是先借着先知警告百姓，然后才降下惩罚。  <br>   神在降灾给埃及之前，先通过摩西警告法老；而在北国灭亡之前，神也反复通过「祂的仆人众先知」（7节）发出了充分的预言和劝告，因此，百姓在管教面前无可推诿。">**注二**</a>]  
3:8 狮子吼叫、谁不惧怕呢。主耶和华发命、谁能不说预言呢。  
3:9 要在亚实突的宫殿中、和埃及地的宫殿里传扬说、你们要聚集在撒玛利亚的山上、就看见城中有何等大的扰乱与欺压的事。  
3:10 那些以强暴抢夺财物、积蓄在自己家中的人不知道行正直的事。这是耶和华说的。  

3:11 所以主耶和华如此说、敌人必来围攻这地、使你的势力衰微、抢掠你的家宅。  
3:12 耶和华如此说、牧人怎样从狮子口中抢回两条羊腿或半个耳朵、住撒玛利亚的以色列人躺卧在床角上或铺绣花毯的榻上、他们得救也不过如此。  
3:13 主耶和华万军之　神说、当听这话、警戒雅各家。  
3:14 我讨以色列罪的日子、也要讨伯特利祭坛的罪。坛角必被砍下、坠落于地。  
3:15 我要拆毁过冬和过夏的房屋、象牙的房屋也必毁灭、高大的房屋都归无有、这是耶和华说的。[<a class = "hovertip" tooltip_text = "今天，信徒在神以外所看重、所倚靠、所追求的，无论是属世的「高大房屋」（15节），还是外表属灵的「伯特利祭坛」（14节），都要被神彻底「拆毁」，才能得以「重新修造」。《列王纪》的历史表明，这是人能「专心顺从耶和华」（王上十一6）的唯一道路；而任何心怀二意的折衷、修补、掺杂，最终都会重归败坏。  ">**注三**</a>]

<br>      
I would like to share my meditation on one verse.  The first part of the verse goes "You only have I known of all the families of the earth. (NKJV)"  What the position believers are! How special we are! Praise the Lord.  The last part of the verse goes "Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. (NKJV)".  What a contrary this is! Believers don't want to read this part.  We would want to hear "How great thou are!".  We would want to hear "God is good, God restored my health".  This verse reminds me God is righteous.  He holds us accountable for sins we made even though we are believers.  Sure, God forgives our sin, and yet we will get consequences, maybe now, maybe at the Judgement Day. Would we be tremble?  Would we want to flee from sins, and live a holy life?  This is what God spoke to a prophet, and was recorded in ‪Amos ‬3:2.
