3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:  
3:2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.  
3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  
3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?  
3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  

3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  
3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  
3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  
3:9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  
3:10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  

3:11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  
3:12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  
3:13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.  
3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  
3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  

3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. &nbsp; &nbsp; [^1]&nbsp; &nbsp;[^2]&nbsp; &nbsp;[^3]&nbsp; &nbsp;[^4]    
3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  
3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  
3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  
3:20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  

3:21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.  
3:22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  
3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  
3:24 For John was not yet cast into prison.  
3:25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.  

3:26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  
3:27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  
3:28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  
3:29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  
3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.  

3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  
3:32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  
3:33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  
3:34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  
3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  

3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  




[^1]: 2022年5月31日活泉小简  
住在磐石中   
「沙番是软弱之类，却在磐石中造房。 (箴三十 26)   
沙番知道自己肉体的软弱，只好躲在岩石中的洞穴，躲避敌人以保安全。我的心哪，愿你从这些软弱之类来学习功课。你像胆怯的沙番一般软弱。生命充满危险，因此要学它们聪明地寻找庇护处。我的安全是在永不改变之耶和华的坚垒里，在其内，祂的应许坚立如磐石巨壁。沙番不会建造城堡，可是它们利用现有的磐石，我不能为自己建造避难所，可是耶稣已为我供应。   
--摘自《静夜亮光》(司布真)   
今天的灵修短文帮助我理解以下的经文：  
约三:16 　神爱世人、甚至将他的独生子赐给他们、叫一切信他的、不至灭亡、反得永生。   
和合本只翻“信他”，NIV版本是"believes in him"。为什么不是"believes him"?  
我们岂不像“沙番”吗？我们一生中满了痛苦、患难；被罪辖制，苦不堪言。因此需要在耶稣那里避难、求保护。  
"in" 的意思是：在耶稣那里，我们经历了平安，经历了保护，所以我们信靠祂。我把我自己放在上帝的手中，相信祂必看顾我！   
[^2]: I read a Spurgeon's devotional message today:  
“The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.” — Proverbs 30:26   
Conscious of their own natural defenselessness, the conies resort to burrows in the rocks, and are secure from their enemies.  
Thou art as weak and as exposed to peril as the timid cony, be as wise to seek a shelter.  My best security is within the munitions of an immutable Jehovah, where His unalterable promises stand like giant walls of rock.  
This message helps me understand John 3:16.
(KJV)  
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  
I now understand a bit more about what "believeth in him" means.  why not say "believeth him".  
"in" means: human beings are no different from conies, we once are under control of sin, therefore we suffered from consequences of it.  What shall we do?  To find a shelter and hide ourselves in it.  Jesus is such the shelter.  We submit ourselves to him, we experienced peace, love from him, therefore we trust him, therefore in Him, we believe Him.

[^3]: ‪Psalms‬143:8 KJV 
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.  
[^4]: Brother J: That is so true. Only in humility will we turn from our own designs and strength and find shelter in him. And only be being in him allows us to share in his death and resurrection.   
Brother J: The  depth of our belief in him (and faith) is demonstrated by how we live our lives. True faith and belief will manifest in the decisions we make.
