16:1 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.  
16:2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  
16:3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.  
16:4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.  
16:5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?  

16:6 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.  
16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.  
16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:  
16:9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;
16:10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

16:11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.  
16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.  
16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.  
16:14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.  
16:15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.  

16:16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.  
16:17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?  
16:18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.  
16:19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?  
16:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.  

16:21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.  
16:22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.  
16:23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.  
16:24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  
16:25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.  

16:26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:  
16:27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.  
16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.  
16:29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.  
16:30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  

16:31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?  
16:32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.  
16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

<h2>The Supremacy of Jesus Christ</h2>  

>He will glorify Me… —John 16:14  

The holiness movements of today have none of the rugged reality of the New Testament about them. There is nothing about them that needs the death of Jesus Christ. All that is required is a <a class = "hovertip" data-html="true" tooltip_text = "虔诚的气氛">pious atmosphere</a>, prayer, and devotion. This type of experience is not supernatural nor miraculous. It did not cost the sufferings of God, nor is it stained with “the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation 12:11). It is not marked or sealed by the Holy Spirit as being genuine, and it has no visual sign that causes people to exclaim with awe and wonder, “That is the work of God Almighty!” Yet the New Testament is about the work of God and nothing else.  

The New Testament example of the Christian experience is that of a personal, passionate devotion to the Person of Jesus Christ. Every other kind of so-called Christian experience is detached from the Person of Jesus. There is no regeneration— no being born again into the kingdom in which Christ lives and reigns supreme. There is only the idea that He is our pattern. In the New Testament Jesus Christ is the Savior long before He is the pattern. Today He is being portrayed as the figurehead of a religion — a mere example. He is that, but He is infinitely more. He is salvation itself; He is the gospel of God!  

Jesus said, “…when He, the Spirit of truth, has come,…He will glorify Me…” (John 16:13-14). When I commit myself to the revealed truth of the New Testament, I receive from God the gift of the Holy Spirit, who then begins interpreting to me what Jesus did. The Spirit of God does in me internally all that Jesus Christ did for me externally.

<h2>耶稣基督的绝对性</h2>  

>他要荣耀我。（约十六14）

今日的宗教敬虔运动，完全没有新约的艰苦实况，不需要耶稣基督的死，要的只是虔诚的气氛、祷告和热心。这一类经验不是超然的，也并不神奇，不需要神的爱情，没有羔羊鲜红的血，没有圣灵的印记，也没有任何记号，叫人看见了惊异说：[这是神大能的作为。] 惟有[神大能的作为]才是新约的要义。

新约的信徒经历，是个人对主耶稣基督热切的爱慕。至於其他所谓信徒经历，都与耶稣本身脱节，并不是新生命的活出，只是一个以耶稣为模范的意念而已。今日他被当作一个有名无实的宗教首领，被视作一个楷模罢了。当然他是楷模，但他远超乎此。他是救恩，他就是神的福音。

耶稣说：[真理的圣灵来了……他要荣耀我。]当我接受了新约的启示，就是接受了神所赐的圣灵；圣灵会向我解明耶稣的作为，把耶稣基督为我所作的客观事实，变作我的主观经历。

祈祷◆噢，主啊，唤醒我、激励我，以致我那必死的身体，能真正顺服祢的灵。
