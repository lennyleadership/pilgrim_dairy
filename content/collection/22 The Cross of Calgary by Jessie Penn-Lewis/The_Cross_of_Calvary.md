<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
"Behold the Lamb of God, which beareth the sin of the world."—John 1:29, margin.  

<h4>Calvary and the Foreshadowed Cross</h4>
"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him."—Luke 23:33, A.V.  

The hour had come! The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world was now to be slain before the eyes of the world. "Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, to do" what had been "foreordained to come to pass" (Acts 4:27-28).  

By picture lessons and prophetic voices, for centuries before, God had been foretelling this dread hour; and He has been directing the world back to it for nearly two thousand years.  

Calvary—which means "The Skull"—is the very pivot of the world's history. All prior things pointed forward to it; and all subsequent things point back to it. Even the future rests upon it, for the redeemed in heaven find it the center of heaven as they behold a Lamb in the midst of the throne, "standing as though it had been slain.”  

Seven hundred years before the Man Christ Jesus was led to the place called Calvary, a prophet inspired of God foreshadowed the cross and gave such a word-picture of the Savior of the world that none but blinded hearts could fail to recognize Him when He came to earth—God manifest in the flesh.  

Through the prophet Isaiah the Spirit of God poured a flood of light upon Calvary; depicting the pathway to the cross, its atoning sacrifice, its sufferings and its fruit—so all who knew the teachings of the book of Isaiah were without excuse as they crucified the Lord of glory.  

The prophecy of Isaiah makes it clear that Christ was "delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2:23), for God "foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ should suffer" (Acts 3:18). And when at Calvary "lawless men did crucify and slay" the "Prince of Life," the rulers of Israel fulfilled the predictions of the prophets they read every sabbath day, by "condemning Him.”  

<h5>The Foreshadowed Lamb of God (Isaiah 53:1-3)</h5>

"He hath no form nor comeliness. . . .”  
<br>"No beauty that we should desire Him.. . .”  
<br>"He was despised and forsaken of men ..." (mg.).  
<br>"A Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. . . .”  
<br>"As one from whom men hide their face He was despised. ...”  

"Who hath believed that which we have heard?" (Isaiah 53:1, mg.) and "to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?" cries the prophet, who was reporting that which he had heard from God. But the message, or report, was so beyond all human thought, so contrary to all human ideas, that he wonders to whom the revelation will be given. For it was revealed to the old-time messengers of God that when they "testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them" (1 Peter 1:11-12), they were ministering to those who, in later years, would hear the message of the cross. And the Apostle Peter writes that the Spirit of Christ Himself was in the prophets, testifying to the sufferings that would come to Him on earth.  

Isaiah foresees the questionings which would fill the minds of men as they heard the marvelous story of that which was told him from God seven hundred years before it came to pass. "Who hath believed?" and "to whom" is it revealed? he exclaims, as he describes the Christ growing up before the Father "as a tender plant; and as a root out of a dry ground." Very precious to God must have been the tender plant—the Branch that would "bear fruit" (Isaiah 11:1). For Israel, the choice vine, the plant of His delight (Isaiah 5:7, mg.), had disappointed the heavenly Husbandman and His cherished vineyard had become dry ground. But here was the Shoot out of a stock in Israel that would bring forth the fruit the Father wanted, although to the eyes of men there would be "no form nor comeliness," no beauty to cause them to desire Him.  

He who was the precious, tender plant to the Father would be despised of men. He would be a "Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief"; therefore they would reject and forsake Him, for suffering and sorrow are not attractive to men.  
To Jehovah, His Righteous Servant would be "exalted and lifted up," even "very high," but to men He would be as one from whom they would hide their faces with astonishment, for His face and His form would be marred "more than the sons of men" (Isaiah 52:14).  
How marred must have been the face of the Holy One of God from His crown of thorns! How lacerated the form of His sacred body from the scourging of the soldiers!—for the scourges were made from hundreds of leathern thongs, each armed at the point with an angular bony hook, or a sharp-edged cube (Krummacher).  

"Look at yonder pillar, black with the blood of murderers and rebels. . . . Look at the rude and barbarous beings who busily surround their victim." See them "tear off His clothes, bind those hands,... press His gracious visage firmly against the shameful pillar," binding Him, "with ropes in such a manner that He cannot move or stir." See! The scourging lasts a full quarter of an hour! The scourges cut ever deeper into the wounds already made, and penetrate almost to the marrow until "His whole back appears an enormous wound" (Krummacher). A purple robe is then thrown over the form of the agonized Sufferer, and the twigs of a long-spiked thorn bush are twisted into a circle, and pressed upon His brow.  
It was thus that His face was marred, and His form more than the sons of men. The prophet Isaiah had even foretold the words of the Man of sorrows, saying in His hour of agony, "I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward. I gave my back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting. For the Lord Jehovah will help Me . . . therefore have I set My face like a flint" (Isaiah 50:5-7).  
Men hid their faces from Him, but "He hid as it were His face from us" is the marginal reading of the A.S.V. Did the group who had seen His face shine as the sun on the Mount of Transfiguration remember the hidden glory in that marred frame? Nay, even they "esteemed Him not" and forsook Him in His hour of shame.  
The divine and human estimations of the Man of sorrows in His pathway to the cross are thus fully foreshadowed by the prophet, and the Holy Spirit as plainly foretells the substitutionary object of His death.  

<h5>The Purpose of the Cross (verses 4-6)</h5>  
"He hath borne our griefs. ...”  
"He hath carried our sorrows. ...”  
"He was wounded for our transgressions. ...”  
"He was bruised for our iniquities. . . .”  
"The chastisement of our peace was upon Him.”  
The Holy Spirit leaves no room for doubt as to the purpose and the cause of the sufferings of Christ. The word substitution is not actually used, but the language is unmistakably clear. This One with the marred face was bearing the "griefs" and "sorrows" of others. His wounds were for their transgressions, and the bruises upon His body were for their iniquities.  
"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath made to light on Him the iniquity of us all" (verse 6, mg.).  
Beholding, as it were, the One thus wounded and stricken—Isaiah knows not actually how— the prophet becomes a spokesman for the whole human race as he cries: "We behold His sufferings, we esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. We, who have gone astray! We, who have turned every one to his own way! But the Lord has laid upon Him—the Holy Son of our God—our iniquity, the iniquity of us all.”  
Thus briefly we have portrayed for us the result of the Fall in Eden and the cause and purpose of the cross.  
Independence of God is the very essence of sin. To every man "his own way" ends in transgression and iniquity. The first all of verse 6 includes every human being brought into the world, and the second all proclaims the atoning sacrifice of Christ for every one under the curse of sin.  

<h5>The Death of the Cross (verses 7-9)</h5>  
"He humbled Himself, and opened not His mouth. ...”  
"A lamb that is led to the slaughter. ...”  
"A sheep that before her shearers is dumb. ...”  
"He was cut off out of the land of the living....”  
"They made His grave with the wicked. ...”  

Isaiah now depicts the obedience unto death of the suffering one. He sees Him as a sheep in the hands of the shearers, dumb and passive; as a lamb being led to the slaughter, innocent and powerless. He who was equal with God counted it not a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself and came in the likeness of men. As man He humbled Himself yet more, even unto death, consenting to be "led to the slaughter" as a victim in the hands of men. How literally the prophecy was fulfilled in every detail the Gospels unfold.  

The Christ standing before Pilate "when He was accused" answered nothing (Matthew 27:12), so that even the Governor marveled. From "oppression and judgment He was taken away" outside the city wall to the place called Calvary, and "as for His generation"—the people of His own nation and time—"who among them considered" the tragedy that was being enacted in their midst?  

"Cut off out of the land of the living" in the very prime of life—how few realized that it was for the transgression of His people "to whom the stroke was due" (Isaiah 53:8).  

How many in Jerusalem during that awful time "considered" and pondered over the Scripture of the prophets, which gave them the portrait of the Man they crucified?  
But the Man of sorrows knew! He said every step of His path must needs be "as it is written of Him." As He set His face to go on His last journey to Jerusalem, it was with the words "All the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of Man. For He shall be delivered up," "mocked," "shamefully treated," "spit upon," "and they shall scourge and kill Him" (Luke 18:31-33).  
He said, "It is written," when Judas betrayed Him, and when His disciples forsook Him; and again, after He was risen from the dead, He reminded them that when He was yet with them He had sought to prepare them for His cross by telling them of "all things that must needs be fulfilled"—revelations written in "the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms" (Luke 24:44), concerning Him.  
Moreover, Isaiah not only foretold the sufferings and death of the Christ but the very way of His burial. His grave would be with the wicked, and He who had been despised and rejected of men would be "with a rich man in His death.”  
This was literally fulfilled; and the instrument prepared by God to carry out His counsels was found in "Joseph of Arimathea, a councilor of honorable estate," who was "looking for the kingdom of God" (Mark 15:43), and said to be a secret disciple of the Lord Jesus.  
Joseph had sat in the council that condemned the Righteous One, but "he had not consented to their counsel and deed." He must have marveled with the Governor at the extraordinary silence of the Divine Sufferer, and in his heart re-echoed the verdict of Pilate that there was no cause worthy of death found in Him.  
Unable to save the victim from His accusers, Joseph did what he could as soon as the sentence of death had been carried out by going boldly to Pilate and asking for the body of the Lord, then reverently laying it in his own new tomb.  

<h5>The Provided Lamb of God (verse 10)</h5>  
"It pleased Jehovah to bruise Him. ...”  
"He hath put Him to grief. ...”  
"His soul a guilt-offering [mg.] for sin. . . .”  
"God will provide Himself a lamb," Abraham had said to Isaac on Mount Moriah, and Isaiah foreshadows the Lamb provided by God Himself, to be revealed in the fullness of time.  
Despised and rejected by men, wounded, bruised, cut off out of the land of the living, this One with the marred face is now plainly described as "a guilt-offering for sin"—the antitype of all the guilt-offerings sacrificed day by day in Israel, by the command of God Himself.  
Hitherto the worshipers had to bring the sacrifice, but when God provided the Lamb, and laid upon Him the iniquity of all, there would be nought for them to do but accept the provision made for them.  
The One who had grown up before the Father as a "tender plant" is "put to grief" by the express will of Jehovah. It was His sovereign pleasure to "bruise Him.”  
In this passage we see Calvary from the standpoint of the Father, who so loved the world that He spared not His own Son but delivered Him up for us all; just as in the preceding paragraph we have foretold the voluntary offering of the Son, when "He humbled Himself" and gave Himself up to death as a "lamb led to the slaughter," a sheep in the hands of the shearers, opening not His mouth.  

<h5>The Fruit of the Cross (verses 10-11)</h5>  
"He shall see His seed. . . .”  
"He shall prolong His days. . . .”  
"He shall see of the travail of His soul. . . .”  
"He shall... be satisfied. . . .”  

Another aspect of the cross is referred to in these words. Calvary is viewed now as in harmony with a law of God—the law of sacrifice for fruitfulness.  
Bruised and put to grief, the Christ is said to "prolong His days" through the seed thus brought into being, and "the pleasure of the Lord" in seeking fruit after His own image prospers in His hand.  
The yearning of the Creator for fellowship with beings created after His own likeness is one of the greatest mysteries in the revelation of the heart and character of Jehovah. "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness" (Genesis 1:26), the Triune God had said, when the beautiful earth, created by His word, lay before Him, but with no beings upon it answering to His heart.  
"He shall see His seed." "He shall see and be satisfied with the travail of His soul" (mg.) reveals the same yearning in the heart of the God-Man. Grieved over the fall of the first creation, He gives His life on Calvary for the birth of a new race, a re-creation of those who had gone astray and turned each one to "his own way." By His death "making many righteous" through His bearing of their iniquities, He beholds the fruit of His travail and is satisfied.  

This new birth for the fallen children of the first Adam is declared to be the fruit of His cross by the Lord Jesus Himself, shortly after the beginning of His public ministry, when He told Nicodemus that sinful men "must" be born again, and that the Son of Man "must" be "lifted up" (John 3:14-16) to become the source of life eternal to them.  

<h5>The Victory of the Cross (verse 12)</h5>  

"Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great. ...”  
"He shall divide the spoil with the strong. . . .”  

Yet another aspect of Calvary is shown us here. Another person, called the "strong," is mentioned, and the language used suggests a battle and the dividing of the "spoil" won in the fight. Elsewhere Isaiah speaks of the "prey of the terrible" and the deliverance of the "captives of the just" from the "mighty" (Isaiah 49:24-25, mg.).  
It is also said that the spoil is given to the Man of sorrows "because He poured out His soul unto death," and "because He . . . was numbered with the transgressors.”  
Calvary was thus to be not only the bearing of our iniquities that we might be healed; not merely the guilt-offering for sin through which we would be made righteous; not just a travail for the birth of a new race in the likeness of the Son of God. It was also a battle with a terrible foe—for the deliverance of those held captive by his power.  
This accords with other passages of Scripture, for David in vision beheld the ascended Lord leading "captivity captive" into the sanctuary on high, and the inspired writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, says that "through death" the Christ brought to nought the devil, that He might "deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (Hebrews 2:15).  
It is written that He took the spoil from the strong because He was "numbered with the transgressors." In perfect obedience to His Father's will, He accepted and drank the cup of suffering and death! How can we fathom what it meant to Him "who knew no sin" to be numbered with the transgressors" and "made sin on our behalf" (2 Corinthians 5:21)? This view of Calvary may reveal to us one cause of the victory of Christ over the terrible one. The devil had sought to be exalted even as the Most High, but the Son of God humbled Himself and consented to be made lower than the lowest. Therefore God highly exalted Him, and gave unto Him the Name which is above every name; for Calvary in its depth of shame on earth was exaltation in heaven.  

<h5>The Effect of the Cross in Heaven (verse 12)</h5>  

"He bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.”  
In this brief sentence we are given a glimpse into the heavens to see the Victor from Calvary within the veil, "before the face of God" (Hebrews 9:24) on behalf of all for whom He died.  
"Numbered with the transgressors," He could make intercession for the transgressors; for He was "touched with the feeling" of their sorrows, having been Himself tempted in all points like as they (yet without sin). For prior to the cross He "suffered being tempted" (Hebrews 2:18) when He walked on earth as man.  
Let us go to Calvary, and in the light thrown on it by the prophecy of Isaiah, behold Him who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame. The hour had come for which he had entered into this world. Hear the God-Man cry "It is finished," as He bows His head and yields up His spirit into His Father's hand! We know now that He is the Father's provided Lamb, the guilt-offering for sin—the One who with a visage more marred than any man's was wounded and bruised for our iniquities, so that by His stripes we may be healed.  
Sometime later, after the day of Pentecost had fully come, a man of authority was riding in his chariot in the desert, reading aloud the prophecy of Isaiah. At the moment he reached the words "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter... His life is taken from the earth," a certain disciple named Philip drew nigh, and was bidden of the Holy Spirit to run over to the chariot. Sitting beside the eunuch, he preached unto him JESUS from the prophecy of Isaiah. The Spirit-given foreshadowing of the cross was now the Spirit-given message to a seeking heart through a messenger instructed by Him (see Acts 8:26-35).  
Thus did the Holy Spirit bear witness that Isaiah had truly foreshown the Christ of God, and that  
"He saw His glory, and he spake of Him" (John 12:41).

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>
"The Spirit of Truth . . . shall glorify Me: for He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you.”—John 16:13-14.  

<h4>The Cross Interpreted by the Ascended Christ</h4>  
"The gospel which was preached by me ... is not after man. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ."— Galatians 1:11-12.  
We have already noticed the teaching of the Apostle Peter that the Spirit of Christ indwelt and controlled the old-time prophets when they testified beforehand about the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.  
This Spirit-testimony not only revealed the Son of God as suffering the death on the cross when His hour had come, but, in the broadest sense, set forth Christ as being the theme of prophecy from the beginning of the world. By the Holy Spirit He inspired the preaching of His coming sacrificial death during the centuries preceding His manifestation to the world. Since this was the case before His passion, there is no reason to think that after He ascended into heaven He then committed the interpretation and proclamation of His crucifixion entirely to the wisdom of men.  
The apostles were eyewitness of His sufferings, but they were not left to preach what each may have thought to be the meaning of the cross, for we find that in the upper room on the Day of Pentecost the Third Person of the blessed Trinity—the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father—takes possession of the chosen band of witnesses to equip them for their work.  
The Holy Spirit, the gift of the Father to the Son for His redeemed on earth, comes forth Himself to bear testimony to the Crucified One and, through His disciples, to witness to His death and rising again.  
"Ye shall receive upon you the power of the Holy Spirit, and ye shall be witnesses unto Me," the risen Lord had declared. And now, energized by the Holy Spirit, we find these chosen witnesses bearing testimony to the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.  
"Ye . . . did crucify and slay," but "God raised up" (Acts 2:23-24). "God hath made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified" (Acts 2:36). "Ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of Life; whom God raised from the dead" (Acts 3:14-15).  
"You crucified the one whom God has raised." This was the burden of the message borne witness to by "distributions of the Holy Spirit," and by signs and wonders done through the name of the crucified and risen Son of God.  
Stephen in particular, "full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people," bearing witness before the Jewish council to the crucified Jesus, and then crowning his testimony by laying down his life for the One who had died for him.  
The fruit of the cross was manifested in a signal way through the death of Stephen, for from his death sprang the one who was to proclaim in mighty powers the full meaning of the sacrifice of the Son of God.  
In the death of Stephen and the resulting conversion of Saul the Pharisee we have an object lesson of the way in which the message of the cross is the power of God. We learn that it is the word of the cross, spoken by the Holy Spirit in conjunction with the spirit of the cross imparted to the messenger, that produces the fruit of the cross in other souls.  
It may even be said that Saul the Pharisee was an eyewitness of the sufferings of the Lord Jesus in His martyr Stephen, for he heard the dying Stephen pray, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge"—just as the Lord had prayed on the cross for those who crucified Him, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”  
We may well believe that an arrow of conviction pierced the heart of Saul that day, and when he so suddenly met the risen Lord on the way to Damascus and heard him say, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks," Saul knew that he had seen the Spirit of Christ in the martyr Stephen ... and the "chosen vessel" was won to the feet of his Lord.  
Isaiah the prophet had been chosen and fitted by God to foreshadow the wondrous story of the cross and portray in tender language the characteristics of the Lamb of God. Even so was Paul chosen by the Lord to receive and proclaim the message of the cross.  
Isaiah and Paul were each prepared for their special service by a personal meeting with God— a meeting which aroused in each such self-abhorrence that Isaiah could but cry, "Woe is me, for I am undone," and the Apostle say, "In me . . .dwelleth no good thing." Each also came to the same entire surrender to God, Isaiah saying, "Here am I, send me," and Paul, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?”  
"Isaiah's bitter weeping over his people" (Isaiah 22:4) and Paul's agony of soul over the blindness of Israel (Romans 9:3) also show that both were men capable of deep suffering and of utter abandonment to the service of God, and that both had largeness of spirit to receive and communicate the teachings of the Spirit of God. Each was given the theme of Calvary, the one in its germ and the other in its full fruition. Each was inspired by the Spirit of Christ Himself—in the one, testifying beforehand of His sufferings, and in the other, interpreting the glorious results of His death.  

We are not surprised, therefore, to find Paul declaring emphatically that the gospel which he preached was "not after man" nor did he "receive it from man"—not even from one who had been an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ; that he was not taught it by anyone, but that it had been given to him by direct "revelation of Jesus Christ." And so he wrote to the Galatians, "The message you have heard from me was out and out divine, authentic from the throne. . . . The risen Lord personally unveiled it to me" (paraphrase outline of Galatians 1:11-24, Moule).  
We have then this wonderful and solemn fact, that the risen and ascended Lord, with the marks of His passion upon the sacred body He carried into heaven, Himself interpreted to Paul the object of His death. If we keep this in mind as we meditate upon the message of Calvary as expressed in the writings of Paul, the "word of the cross" will in truth be unto us the "energy of God.”  
That the gospel of the cross as preached by Paul was given him directly by the Lord Himself is also proved by the results of his visit to the leading apostles of Christ in Jerusalem. "By revelation" (Galatians 2:2) Paul is bidden to lay before the apostles the gospel he was preaching among the Gentiles, and when he did this he found that he had been taught so fully by the risen Lord Himself that they who had seen Christ die, had held converse with Him after He was risen from the dead, and had been filled with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, had nothing to impart to the one chosen of the Lord to proclaim the message of His love.  
Not only had they nothing to impart, but they "perceived the grace given unto him," and acknowledged that this man had in truth been "entrusted with the gospel" (Galatians 2:6-9). Accordingly they gave unto him the "right hand of fellowship," proving for all time that the gospel preached by him was in full harmony with the gospel proclaimed by all the apostles—the gospel doubtless given to them by Christ Himself when after His passion He appeared unto them "by the space of forty days," "speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God" (Acts 1:3).  
Since the message of Calvary was therefore given to Paul by direct revelation of the Lord, we do not marvel that it dominated his life and was woven into the very texture of all his writings. Burnt into his heart, he who had not seen the God-Man actually die1 preached His cross and passion with such intensity and such manifest illumination of the Holy Spirit that he could declare to the Galatians that "Jesus Christ had been painted large upon His cross to their very eyes" (translation of Galatians 3:1, Moule).  
May God the Holy Spirit bear witness again to the gospel of the cross through Paul as we reverently listen to the Lord Himself, through His messenger, interpreting His death.  

<h5>The Cross to the Natural Man</h5>
"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit... they are foolishness unto him."—1 Corinthians 2:14.  
"The word of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness." — 1 Corinthians 1:18.  
"Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumbling-block, and unto Gentiles foolishness." — 1 Corinthians 1:23.  
Although Paul received his gospel by direct revelation of Jesus Christ, he was under no delusion as to its reception by the natural man. Like Isaiah he knew that the cross as the "arm of the Lord" must be revealed by the Holy Spirit, for to the darkened intellect (Ephesians 4:18) and rebellious will of the children of unbelief, the whole message would appear but folly.  
"Salvation through the death of another? It is contrary to all justice! Man unable to save himself? No, it is all folly!”  
To the Jews the word of the cross would be a still greater stumbling block. Was it not written in their Scriptures, "He that is hanged is accursed in the sight of God" (Septuagint)?  
Again and again Paul must have had the words cast in his teeth, "accursed of God," or "an insult to God," as he preached to the Jews a crucified Messiah, for in speaking of the Lord Jesus they often called Him by the name "the gibbetted one," which they found in the original Hebrew of Deuteronomy 21:23 (Lightfoot).  
Apart from the illumination of the Spirit, the Jews could not see that the very words in Deuteronomy interpreted the cross of Christ, who became a "curse for us" on the tree of Calvary.  
But the Jews were looking for a Messiah who would reign as a King on earth, and in reading the prophecy of Isaiah they had only seen foreshadowings of glory and kingship in the Coming One. With preconceived ideas as to the tokens of authority which would make known unto them their looked-for Messiah, the Jews had demanded of the Lord Jesus again and again to "show us a sign from heaven," and with pain the Lord had replied, "There shall no sign be given" but "the sign of Jonah." "For as Jonah ... so shall the Son of Man be ... in the heart of the earth" (Matthew 12:38-40).  
Calvary and the grave, foretold by the prophet Isaiah and pictured again in the mysterious experience of Jonah the prophet, was the special "sign" promised by God to make known the Messiah, but Isaiah had written of Israel, "their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed" (Matthew 13:14-16), and his prophecy concerning the blinded people was fulfilled.  
1 If Paul had been present at the tragedy of Golgotha, surely he would have made some reference to it in his writings.  
9
"The Jews ask for signs," writes Paul, but have not eyes to see the signs foretold by God; the "Greeks seek after wisdom," and fail to perceive that "Christ crucified" is the power and wisdom of God.  
The Cross and Human Wisdom
"The word of the cross ... is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise."—1 Corinthians 1:18-19.  
Paul, who had himself once been a Pharisee rejecting with bitter antagonism the story of a crucified Messiah, with heaven-lit vision sees deeply into the purpose of the cross. He beholds it as the master-stroke of Jehovah against one cause of the Fall in Eden.  
"The woman saw that the tree . . . was to be desired to make one wise" (Genesis 3:6).  
The desire of knowledge beyond the limit set by the Lord was one of the causes of the Fall, the effect thereof continuing unto this day, for pride of intellect is still a barrier between men and the knowledge of their Creator.  
Salvation through the cross was a master-stroke of the All-wise Creator against the pride of knowledge in His fallen creatures, for the "word of the cross" is the power of God to "destroy" or bring to nought "the wisdom of the wise." The cross as the power of God is so wholly beyond the comprehension of the natural man that he must submit his intellect to his Creator and accept the message on the word of Jehovah alone.  
"The foolishness of God is wiser than men," says the Scripture, and in the day when all men shall know themselves as they are known by their Creator, all that appeared to carnal reasoning as "foolishness" will be proved to be the highest wisdom of God.  
The "word of the cross" is the energy of God and through it the All-wise Lord is already making "foolish" the "wisdom of the world"; for while the world "through its wisdom" is failing utterly to know Him, it is "God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the thing preached" (1 Corinthians 1:21, mg.) to "save them that believe." Through the "thing preached" which is accounted foolishness, God is working the miracle of salvation from the guilt and power of sin and recreating a new race after the likeness of Him who is the Firstborn of many brethren—the Firstborn from the dead.  
The "weakness of God" manifested in Him who was "crucified through weakness" is "stronger than men." The weak and suffering Savior upon His cross of shame is mighty to save all who believe in Him.  
The Cross and True Wisdom
"Howbeit we speak wisdom... yet a wisdom not of this world.... We speak God’s wisdom in a mystery."—1 Corinthians 2:6-8.  
The word of the cross, unto those who are "being saved," is the power of God to bring to nought the pride of knowledge so that they may be taught God's wisdom: "things which eyes saw not, and ears heard not, and which entered not into the heart of man.”  
It is a wisdom which is a mystery to the natural man, but which is revealed by the Spirit of God unto all those who love God; a wisdom, writes the Apostle, which will be "unto our glory" when the wisdom of this world shall have passed away.  
"God's wisdom in a mystery" is "the mystery of God, even Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden" (Colossians 2:2-3). A Messiah crucified is unto the called, both Jews and Greeks, the power of God and the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:23-24, mg.).

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered... arm ye yourselves with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin."—1 Peter 4:1, mg.  
The Twofold Message of the Cross  
"Having made peace through the blood of His cross ... you ... hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death."—Colossians 1:20-22.  
The prophecy of Isaiah tells us that the sufferings and death of the Man of Sorrows were not for Himself but for those who had gone astray: "an offering for sin" by the express will of the Father, who was pleased to "bruise Him" and "put Him to grief.”  
Paul the Apostle takes up the same theme and writes to the Romans that God Himself purposed the sacrifice of Christ Jesus to be "a propitiation through faith in His blood" (Romans 3:25), for only thus could He "pass over sin" and show His righteousness to a guilty world.  
Jehovah spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all! Yea, it is written that God Himself "was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself," for Father and Son are One.  
Heralds sent forth and equipped by God the Holy Spirit must proclaim the tidings of peace. Commissioned by the risen Son of God as His ambassadors, they are to plead on "behalf of Christ" with perishing souls, and "as though God were entreating" by them they are to say, "Be ye reconciled to God.”  
To the Colossians, Paul writes, "Having made peace through the blood of His cross" you—who were separated from God, and enemies to God, because of your evil doings—"you . . .now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death" (1:20-22).  
"Having made peace through the blood of His cross" refers to the propitiatory aspect of the sacrifice of Christ when He trod the winepress alone, and of the people there were none with Him (Isaiah 63:3, A.V.). However, the reconciliation of the sinner to God "in the body of His flesh through death" shows us the Savior and the saved becoming as one. In this latter aspect we see the second Adam as the Representative Man, and discern how, in His death, all who are united to Him by faith have suffered the penalty of their sins and are reconciled to God through Him.  
"In the body of His flesh through death, [His intent is] to present you holy and without blemish and unreprovable before Him," continues the Apostle.  
The cross is the gateway through which the reconciled soul passes into the new sphere where it is presented in Christ to the Father as "holy and without blemish and unreprovable before Him." Those who are thus reconciled die with Christ to their old sins. Their "evil works," which made them alienated and enemies to God in their mind, are now left behind. They are not reconciled to continue in the life they lived before.  
The message of "peace through the blood of His cross" and reconciliation to God in the body of Christ through death, therefore, includes deliverance from the power as well as the guilt of sin.  
In still plainer language does the Apostle Peter proclaim the deliverance from the bondage of sin in linkage with the remission of past sins. Writing in his First Epistle about the sufferings of Christ, he says, "His own self bare our sins in His body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness” (1 Peter 2:24). The alternative reading given in the margin of the A.S.V. is still more striking, for it says that Christ "carried up our sins in His body to the tree"— surely not that we might continue under their control and do them again and again!  
The union of the believer with his Savior in death is thus clearly expressed by the Apostle. Having made peace by the atoning sacrifice of His cross, the Lord Jesus carried our sins to the tree so that in Him we have died to them and their power—and now, sharing His life from God, we may "live unto righteousness" by the might of the Holy and Righteous One who dwells within our hearts.  
"By whose stripes ye were healed" adds the Apostle, quoting the prophecy of Isaiah, and linking the deliverance from the guilt and bondage of sin to that most sacred foreshadowing of the cross.  
It was the Lamb of God who had the actual bruising and suffering on our behalf, and this was so that the healing power of His life might be imparted to us. We who believe that He has carried our sins to the tree, and in Him have died unto those sins, are henceforth to live unto God.  
This is the message of Calvary as revealed unto Paul by the risen Lord, and by the words of Peter confirmed as the gospel preached by all the apostles in the days since Pentecost. Incalculable loss has come to the Church of God by the frequent severance of these two aspects of the "word of the cross" in its proclamation of the gospel of Calvary.  
Moreover, deliverance from the power of sin was manifestly not taught by Paul as an "advanced" experience, for when he wrote to the converts in Rome he seemed to speak of our death with Christ as an elementary stage of experience—ignorance of which surprised him—for their fellowship with Christ's death was the only basis upon which they could realize the newness of life in Him.  
11
The Cross and the Bondage of Sin
"Crucified with Him . . . that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin."—Romans 6:6.  
"Reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved in His life" (Romans 5:10, mg.), writes Paul to the Romans, as he goes on to show the wondrous plan of God, that all who are thus reconciled and recipients of the gift of righteousness should "reign in life" (Romans 5:17). As sin had once reigned over them, even so might grace reign through Jesus Christ.  
But someone may raise the question, "Should we not then continue in sin so that God may show more of His abounding grace?" (see Romans 6:1). "God forbid!" bursts forth the Apostle. The death of Christ, and the free grace of God abounding therefrom, can never be meant to minister to sin!  
It is true that God's abounding grace is given to sinners through the death of His Son, but with the Son of God we "died." Then how shall we who have died to sin live any longer therein? (Romans 6:2).  
The Apostle of the Cross is deeply moved as he writes! By "revelation of Jesus Christ" he had been shown the meaning of Calvary, and in the light of the cross had seen the depth of the Fall and the exceeding sinfulness of sin—which demanded nothing less than the death of the Son of God Himself, in unparalleled suffering and shame, to rescue the doomed sinner.  
"Continue in sin" when Christ had died to deliver from sin? God forbid! Sin has abounded, but "grace did abound more exceedingly" to save the sinner from his bonds.  
In the light shining upon Calvary as unveiled to him by Christ, the Apostle shows the meaning of that death so that none in Rome could be ignorant any longer of the purpose for which Christ died.  
"Our old man was crucified with Him" is the message of Calvary to the fallen sinner, and is the secret of deliverance from the bondage of sin. All who were baptized into Christ "were baptized into His death." Through "baptism into death" they were buried into His grave for the express purpose "that like as Christ was raised from the dead" (Romans 6:4), they might look upon His cross and grave as a great gulf fixed between them and their past, and with the risen Christ emerge to "walk in newness of life" (Romans 6:4).  
This, of course, was if they were really and intimately united with the Lord in His death! A mental assent alone would not produce a real union with the risen Lord. They must by the Holy Spirit be so vitally united with the crucified One that they shared the very "likeness" of His death (Romans 6:5).  
And if this union existed, then they would realize the power of His resurrection and know that they were "crucified with Him." So they would "no longer be in bondage to sin"—slaves of sin—for "he that hath died is justified from sin" (Romans 6:6-7). Sin has no longer a claim to reign—its tyranny is over.  
Moreover, the death of Christ meant more than negative deliverance. They were set free from the reign of sin not only by death but by life. The life of Christ which triumphed over death and the grave would be manifested in them; for if they truly "died" to the old they would live with Christ and share the life that He now lives—a new life, a life "unto God" (Romans 6:10).  
Abundant life—a reigning in life—was the purpose of Calvary. The death Christ died He died unto sin for us, and He died "once for all" (Romans 6:10, mg.). So they were to reckon themselves dead unto sin with Him and utterly refuse to let it reign over them, for they were "alive unto God in Christ Jesus." Abiding in Him as their very life, they would reign in life in Jesus Christ their Lord.  
But they must not forget that this must be lived out in practice! They cannot be truly crucified with Christ and at the same time yield to sin or hand over the members of their body as instruments of unrighteousness, or else they would be making "void the grace of God." If they desired to realize the full deliverance of Calvary, they must not only gladly recognize their death with the Crucified One but they must present themselves unto God as "men living after death" (Romans 6:13, Moule), and in "newness of life" yield the members of their bodies unto God as weapons of righteousness.  
But another question arises here. Will not the grace that sets us free bring in a danger of license beyond the bounds of liberty? (Romans 6:15).  
"God forbid!" again cries the Apostle. Did they not know that the change brought about by union with Christ in His death and resurrection meant a revolution deep down in the center of a man's being? That those who had thus proved the power of Christ's death became "obedient from the heart" to that pattern whereunto they "were delivered" (Romans 6:17, mg.)? In newness of life, true believers gladly became "servants of God" instead of servants to sin, and of their own free choice chose day by day to present their bodies as "bondservants of righteousness" in joyous obedience unto God.  
In this chapter in Romans the severing power of the cross is clearly seen. The work of deliverance from the guilt and bondage of sin was accomplished at Calvary, and the Apostle calls upon the Roman Christians to enter upon the fruit of Christ's death by a decisive act of faith. With Christ upon the cross they died, and in His death they were cut off from their old life. "United with Him by the likeness of His death," they were to account themselves crucified with Him, "dead indeed unto sin" (Romans 6:11, A.V.), and living unto God in Him.  
"But I have reckoned thus, and it seems nothing but reckoning a lie!” cries some longing heart.  
12
Ah, soul, maybe your eyes are in the wrong direction. You are looking within, occupied more with your "reckoning" than with the work of your Savior. The Holy Spirit will not bear witness to your "reckon" apart from the object of your reckoning.  
Look away to Calvary. The Lord Jesus died on your behalf, and as your Representative carried you with Him to His cross. Are you honestly determined to part with every known sin, and willing for the death with Christ to be made practical in your experience? Then from this crucial moment see yourself as nailed to the tree with your crucified Lord.  
Relying upon the Holy Spirit, and in faith in the word of God, "let not sin therefore reign," for God has said that through Christ's death and your sharing of that death "sin shall not have the mastery over you" (Romans 6:14, C.H.).  
Hidden in Christ upon His cross and joined to Him in His life, your part, O child of God, is the continual choice of your will—for "to whom ye yield," his "servants ye are" (Romans 6:16, A.V.). In the hour of sore temptation, in the center of your being you must promptly retire, so to speak, to the cross, and, hiding in Him who carried you there, refuse to be drawn out of your place in Him. Do not struggle with anything that comes to you, but hand over all to Him whose life you do share, and you shall find that He is able to deliver and to keep you day by day.  
"But now, being freed from the bondage of sin, and enslaved to the service of God" (Romans 6:22, C.H.), you must deal honesty with sin, calling sin, sin. Be steadfastly purposed to walk in obedience to your Lord, counting upon Him to work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure.  
Let every stress of trial or temptation drive you to the searchlight of His face that you may see all things in His light. So shall you "walk in the light as He is in the light," with the precious blood of Jesus Christ cleansing you from all sin. "And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous"—He who is "the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world" (1 John 2:1-2).  
But before we crave deliverance we must necessarily feel the weight of our chains. At this point we come to the purpose of the law, unfolded in the seventh chapter of Romans.  

<h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>
"Faithful is the saying: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him."—2 Timothy 2:11.  
The Cross and the Law
"Ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ.. . . Now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden."—Romans 7:4-6.  
DELIVERANCE through death is still the message of the Apostle. The cross of Calvary is the place of reconciliation with God and of freedom from the power of sin, but he who is crucified with Christ dies with Him not only to the bondage of sin but to the bondage of the "law? which demanded from a helpless sinner an obedience it could not get and brought him deeper and deeper into the powerlessness of death. The Apostle's trend of thought in Romans 5, 6, 7 and 8 is marvelously in accord with the facts of actual experience in the Christian life. In fact, this group of chapters can only be clearly understood from the inside—that is, by having in some measure passed through these stages of experience, so as to be able to see things from the standpoint of Paul as he wrote to the Roman Christians.  
"The law came in" he writes, "that the trespass might abound" (Romans 5:20-21). But God only purposed to reveal the "abounding" of the sin and its heinousness so that His grace might be shown to "abound more exceedingly.”  
That "as sin reigned" (Romans 5:20-21) over the poor sinner, even so might "grace"—the free gift of righteousness—"reign" and triumph in the redeemed man.  
The way that grace might come in and reign is then shown to be by death, for nothing but death could release the sinner from his chains. The wages of sin is death. The penalty of sin must be paid; the verdict of death must be carried out. And in the death of Christ as the Representative Man the penalty was carried out, and the reign of sin ends in all who have died with their crucified Lord.  
The believer also dies to the law which condemned him to death. United to Christ in His death, he is "made dead to the law through the body of Christ" (Romans 7:4), and is therefore "discharged" from the claims of the law, "having died" to that which held him in bondage.  
The law can no longer say to one who has died, "Thou shalt," for he has passed through the gateway of death to another sphere, where the law cannot follow him—a sphere "in Christ Jesus" wherein he serves God in a new way, with a new spirit of glad obedience to the letter of the law (Romans 7:6).  
Another question occurs at this point: Are we then to say that the "law" given by God is sin? (cf. Romans 7:7). Once more the Apostle answers "God forbid!" and proceeds to show the reason why the law was given and the practical working of the law in bringing the soul to the place where he is ready to be delivered by the crucified and risen Lord. For the message of deliverance through death with Christ comes as glad tidings only to those who are at an end of themselves. The law is our schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ.  
After speaking of the discharge from the claims of the law, the Apostle breaks out into vivid description of the bitter conflict in the soul of the one who delights in the will of God in his inward man but has failed to yet apprehend this deliverance through the death of Christ which Paul has been describing.  
Whatever primary object Paul may have had in mind when he wrote the much-debated seventh chapter of Romans, at least we may safely say that it is a powerful picture of a man under the tyranny of sin who is roused to activity by his desire to fulfill the will of God.  
It is the law that brings the soul to the place of death, for "death" is simply a cessation from struggling—the point at which the soul arrives when it can battle no more and cries in despair, "Who shall deliver me?”  
"/ through the law died unto the law? writes Paul, "that I might live unto God" (Galatians 2:19).  
It is easy to discuss the seventh chapter of Romans from the academic point of view, but if we set ourselves in earnest to break our own bonds we will soon learn the reality of the picture and the bitterness of the experience it describes.  
Let us look briefly at the passage and see how the law works in bringing souls to an end of themselves, ready to be delivered by Jesus Christ our Lord.  
The Law Was Given to Make Us Know What Sin Is  
"I had not known sin, except through the law."—Verse 7.  
For instance, unless God had given a law and said, "Thou shalt not covet," how could we know that to covet was a sin?  
The Law Was Given to Show the Antagonism of Sin
14
"Sin, finding occasion, wrought in me... coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead."—Verse 8.  
How actually true in every human heart the picture is! If we are told not to covet, we find ourselves doing at once the very thing we are forbidden to do.  
"Thou shalt not" arouses against the holy will of God all the antagonism that is in fallen human nature, for "the mind of the flesh is enmity against God" (Romans 8:7).  
Apart from the commands of the law "sin is dead" i.e., there is no antagonism or fight. Let men go their own way and fulfill the desires of their flesh and of their mind and there is no battle; but let them come face to face with the law of God and try to obey it, then sin rouses up and works all manner of things in them contrary to the commandment of God.  
The law is therefore given to show the man himself the antagonism that is within him to the law of God.  
The Law Was Given to Bring Us to Death  
"I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."—Verse 9.  
Once upon a time I knew nothing of the claims of God, "I was alive, apart from the law.”  
I thought all was well—but suddenly I came face to face with the "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not" of my Creator. Something within me woke up and fought against God's law; "sin revived" where it had been dormant. I found I could not obey the law, for I was helpless.  
Yes, sin took its opportunity and asserted its power and claim upon me through the very commandment of God. I found it actually stronger than myself. It beguiled me! I had to yield to its' temptations, even while knowing the consequences to be death. So to speak, sin "slew me" (v. 11) by showing me that I had nothing before me but the wages of sin—death.  
God's commandment should have led me to live a better life, but instead it made me sink deeper into the helplessness of death (v .10), and in hopeless despair, "I died.”  
The Law Was Given to Show the Sinfulness of Sin
"The law is holy . . . righteous, and good. But sin, . . . shown to be sin, ... through the commandment [became] exceeding sinful."—Verses 12-13.  
"Sin ... shown to be sin” by the holiness of the law! How wonderful is the plan devised by the Creator to teach the creature—who has no conception of sin—what sin is, and still more to make him know his need of salvation.  
Sin must become "exceeding sinful" before it is loathed—before one's desire is aroused to have it put away and deliverance known from its bonds.  
The need of a Savior must be felt before the Savior Himself can be welcomed.  
The depth of one's fall must be seen or else the height, and depth, and breadth, and length of salvation cannot be understood.  
"Through the commandment"—holy, righteous, and good, and one's vain efforts to fulfill it—God brings the fallen one to know himself and his condition.  
The Law Brings to the Helplessness of Death  
"Sin . . . working death to me.. . .”  
"Sold under sin. ...”  
"In me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing."—Verses 13, 14, 18.  
How bitter the strife! How humiliating to the pride of man! "The law is spiritual" cries the man, "but I—I am carnal, sold under sin? I am practically a slave, for "what I hate, that I do" (v. 15).  
The very fact that I hate sin proves that my eyes are opened to the beauty and goodness of God's will (v. 16), so that I seem to be like two persons. In my will I desire to do right, but I am utterly unable to "do that which is good " (v. 18). Therefore, in one sense, it is not I that work the wrong but the sin which reigns and tyrannizes over me (v. 17).  
I am truly a slave! What slavery is worse than this? At all events, I know now that .'"in me . . . dwelleth no good thing" (v. 18). I see no man on earth blacker than myself. I can never think again that "I am not as other men." Was ever a soul in such bonds before? The "good" I want to do, I do not do; and the "evil" which I abhor, I practice (v.19)!  
To sum it all up, I find that "to me who would do good, evil is present (v. 21). I am in the condition that "/ delight in the law of God after the inward man" (v. 22), but I see a different law in my members "warring against the law of my mind" (v. 23). I am held as a slave under the tyranny of sin.  
15
The Point of Deliverance  
"O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me out of this body of death?"—Verse 24, mg.  
"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."— Verse 25.  
Yes, there is deliverance when the soul is ready to be delivered. The "wretched man" has cried out for help, and in his cry has confessed that he is unable to deliver himself!  
The pride of life has been broken down.  
The "inward man" desiring to obey the law, has not been able to conquer himself or his sins, notwithstanding all his efforts to do "that which is good" in the sight of God. He has failed as yet to apprehend the full message of the cross. He has not seen his death with Christ, and his freedom in Christ from the tyranny of sin and the claims of the law. So in this bitter conflict he has had to find out his need.  
Maybe he thought that the "inward man," assisted by the grace of God, would be able to please God—that having begun in the Spirit, by reconciliation with God through the blood of the cross, he could be "perfected" (or grow in grace) by the aid of the flesh!  
Not so, you "wretched man." Turn again to Calvary! You need another force within you—the power of the Holy Spirit, and the "law of the Spirit of life in Christ" alone can make you free through the work of Jesus Christ on Calvary.  
The "law" which you have been struggling to obey in your own strength "hath dominion over a man" only for "so long a time as he liveth" (Romans 7:1).  
You were crucified with your Savior, you have died with Him, and you are "made dead to the law" through the body of Christ.  
Yes, "by faith in the working of God" (Colossians 2:12). Do you believe this?  
Then you are discharged from the claims of the law—"having died"! You are "joined to ... Him who was raised from the dead" (Romans 7:4), and as you rely upon Him to work in you, "the law of the Spirit of life" in Him will make you free (Romans 8:2-3), and "if the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”  
You shall find that "what the law could not do" (Romans 8:3), by commanding you from without, God's own Son, sent in your likeness to die in your place, can do within you; and the very "requirement of the law" (Romans 8:4, mg.) which you have so utterly failed to obey, shall now be fulfilled in you as you yield to the Spirit of God and "walk not after the fleshy but after the Spirit?  
Oh soul, you have lived in ceaseless condemnation. No longer need this be! Those who have cried for deliverance "through Jesus Christ our Lord" and recognized the answer of death within themselves that they should not trust in themselves but in God who raises the dead—for them "there is no condemnation." For "in Christ Jesus" they experience the force of a new law, an in-working Spirit of life, making them free from the old law with its reign of sin.  
“For freedom did Christ set us free: standfast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage" (Galatians 5:1, mg.). See that you walk step by step in the Spirit, minding "the things of the Spirit" (Romans 8:5). By the power of the Spirit of life which dwells in you, realize the fact that you are a child of the Father, and if a child, then an heir—an heir of God, and joint-heir with Christ, if so be that you suffer with Him, that you may be glorified together (see Romans 8:16-17).  

<h3>CHAPTER 5</h3>
"To this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord."—Romans 14:9.  
Crucified with Christ  
"I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God. I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ."— Galatians 2:19-20.  
Paul does not hesitate to refer to his own experience, for he does not preach to the Romans or to the Galatians a gospel which he has not himself proved. Now, all that he has written to the Romans concerning the believer's death with Christ he sums up in this personalized passage in his epistle to the Galatians.  
To the Romans he said "we" and "our," but to the Galatians he said "I"! "I died unto the law," "I have been crucified with Christ.”  
In these words we have embodied the deepest meaning of the deliverance accomplished at Calvary, and the more simply we take the message the more quickly shall we prove the word of the cross as the power of God to deliver.  
This "I," which has been the central spring of every human life since the Fall; this "I," cries Paul, was "crucified with Christ.” And the law was the means of bringing me to this place of death— the place where I acknowledged my hopeless condition, the place where I ceased from my struggles and cried out for help from another. The "law" brought me to this place where I died to the law by sheer inability to obey it,2 and from thence I fled to hide myself in the death of Christ. . . and now I have died with Him.  
We need to remember that no word of God is exhausted in one application. As we are led on by Him, we find the message of the cross opening out with an ever-widening meaning to meet an ever-deepening need. At first we apprehend our death with Christ simply in relation to the bondage of sin. Initially, with our eyes on the crucified Lord dying for us, we listen to the declaration of Paul in Romans 6:6, "our old man was crucified with Him,”' and we reckon ourselves dead unto sin and cast away "anger, passion and malice . . . evil-speaking and reviling" (Colossians 3:8, C.H.) and all the manifest "works of the flesh." Thereby we prove with joy that the word of the cross is the power of God to all who believe, and find that the living Christ is "able to save completely them that draw near to God through Him" (Hebrews 7:25, mg.).  
But sooner or later we find out that we need a deeper deliverance. Our lives are still in some measure self-centered, although we reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin and find deliverance from the manifest works of the flesh. Self shows itself. Self-energy or self-complacency in service, self-pity when we are suffering, self-seeking in desiring the praise of men, self-introspection and self-judgment in hours of trial, self-sensitiveness in contact with others, self-defense when we are injured. Yes, and sometimes, above all, a self-consciousness that makes life almost a burden. These are some of the indignations of the self-center within.  
In the energy of self, desiring to be wholly the Lord's, we may sometimes consecrate ourselves to Him and with new vigor seek to work for Him oblivious of the self-source of our activities, until we are spent out; or, finding little spiritual fruit from all our labor, our eyes are opened to see the uselessness of all our "creaturely activity" for Him (see Soul and Spirit and other books).  
It is at this point that the Spirit of God brings the "word of the cross" to us with a fresh and blessed message of deliverance—a deliverance that, to some lives, has meant greater consequences than the freedom from the bondage of sin which they proved in earlier days.  
The Lord Jesus in His call to the cross touched the core of the trouble in every person's life when He said, "If any man would come after Me, let him deny himself." The Lord did not say his sins, or certain exterior things. He who knew what was in man struck deeper than actions, to the very center of a man, and said "deny himself.”  
Let a man renounce himself and see himself as crucified with Christ, and quickly another Himself—the Lord Christ—will take the central place in the heart and quietly bring all things under His sway!  
"Each one of you saith, I" (1 Corinthians 1:12), wrote Paul to the Corinthians about the cause of the contentions in that church; and throughout Scripture instance after instance is given of the "I" in its various forms.  
"Is not this great Babylon which I have built?" (Daniel 4:30), cries Nebuchadnezzar. "I will say to my soul... take thine ease" (Luke 12:19), says the one whose delight was in earthly treasure. "I am not as the rest of men" (Luke 18:11) is the self-estimation of the moral man. "I am holier than thou" (Isaiah 65:5), the inner thought of the self-righteous. "I am rich . . . and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17), the attitude of the self-satisfied. The "I am" of this one or that one mirrors the "I" of the Christian who walks "after the manner of men." "For when one saith, l am of Paul; and another, I am ofApollos; are ye not men?" (see 1 Corinthians 3:1-4) writes the Apostle.  
2 "The sense of feebleness, or prostration, to which man is reduced by the working of the law," is "the process of dying in fact."—Lightfoot.  
17
But "I" crucified with Christ was Paul's charter of freedom. With this message of the cross he met every difficulty of the Christians of his day. "We who died," "All died," "For ye died," was his reiterated statement as he dealt practically with the children of God about their attitude to sin and the elements of the world in the Church of God. And the souls to whom he wrote knew that he lived it out in his own life. He did not say "I have been crucified with Christ" and then seek the highest place, even though he might have "claimed honor" (1 Thessalonians 2:6, mg.) as an apostle of Christ.  
"I am nothing" he wrote to the Corinthians, and I "am less than the least of all saints," to the Ephesians. "No longer I" was the whole spirit of his life, as he counted all things loss for CHRIST and became, as it were, the off-scouring of all things for His dear sake.  
For crucified with Christ is Paul's invariable declaration, and from whichever point of view he speaks of the results of the death of Christ, he uniformly keeps Calvary as the basic fact. In all his unfolding of truth he never goes beyond the radius of the cross. The Greek word which the Apostle uses in Galatians 2:20 (also in Romans 6:6) is a compound form meaning "to crucify together" and "crucified together with Christ" must be the fact upon which our faith rests if we are to know continuous deliverance. For the eyes of the heart must be focused upon the crucified Christ and not be turned inward upon any subjective experience.  
"Looking unto Jesus" is the way of deliverance at every stage of the spiritual life. We "look" at the Christ upon His cross, just as the Israelites looked away from their dire condition to the serpent lifted up in the wilderness—look away from ourselves to Calvary for salvation—and as we look we live. Again we "look" and see ourselves crucified with Christ, and in the faith which unites us to Him we reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin and cast away every known sin, refusing to let it reign over us; and—in so far as we honestly desire and expect the victory—the Holy Spirit seals our faith with real deliverance.  
Once more we look to Calvary and see that we have died to the law, for God no longer says "Thou shalt" to those who are in Christ. As we yield obedience to the law of Christ, God sends forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, whereby we cry "Abba Father," and learn to look to Him to supply our every need.  
Again we "look" to Calvary, and with clearer vision see ourselves—"/" crucified with Him. As the Spirit illuminates the message, we marvel that we did not understand the wondrous secret long before. We have but to make way for the living Christ by taking His cross as ours and He will manifest Himself through us.  
And is this all? No, no. As He who died and rose again occupies the throne within, in His light we shall see light; and as new departments of our complex beings are brought into the searchlight of His Presence, we shall discover ever deeper depths of our need and find Calvary again and again the place of life.  
"Crucified with Christ!" His cross is mine! I am there with Him. I consent to share His cross, and meet all things with "No longer I!" "I have no longer a separate existence. I am merged in Christ" (Lightfoot), so He, the Living One, will move forth through me, working in me that which is well-pleasing in His sight.  

<h3>CHAPTER 6</h3>
"He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them that believe"—2 Thessalonians 1:10, A. V.  
The Cross and the Living Christ  
"I have been crucified with Christ ... no longer I, but Christ liveth in me."—Galatians 2:20.  
It was the good pleasure of God to reveal His Son in me," writes the Apostle earlier in his epistle to the Galatians. The "mystery which hath been hid from all ages . . . now is manifested to His saints," he writes to the Colossians. It is a mystery which God is pleased to make known to His children—"the riches of the glory of this mystery . . . which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:26-27).  
This is the end, or purpose, of the cross. We are crucified with Christ to make room for Him to dwell in our hearts by faith, and this indwelling of the Lord Christ is called a "mystery"—a word signifying "secret," something hid from our understanding until revealed to us.  
This mystery was not made known under the Dispensation of Law. Then every man stood by his own "works" before God, except a few like Abraham who in the Spirit foresaw the "day" of Christ and were glad; they saw the promises afar off, and embraced them. But during the Dispensation of the Church it is God's purpose that the "mystery" should be proclaimed to all nations, that those who are "obedient to the faith" (see Romans 16:25-26) may share its glory.  
Paul said he was made a minister to "fulfill the word [or purpose] of God, even the mystery"; and his burden of heart was that others should "gain in all its richness the full assurance of understanding; truly to know the mystery of God" (Colossians 2:2, C.H.) which "by revelation was made known” (Ephesians 3:3, C.H.) to him. Especially the eternal purpose of God, that men of every tongue and tribe and nation were to share in the unsearchable riches of Christ. Paul said it was a special gift of grace to him that he should be chosen by God to bear among all nations such glad tidings, and to bring "light to all," that each might behold the "stewardship of the mystery”—the trust given to each to whom it is revealed to carry the message to all people, "to the intent that to the principalities and powers" in the heavenly realm (who are watching the dealings of God with a fallen creation) may be made known "through the Church" the manifold wisdom of God (Ephesians 3:10).  
The revelation of Christ in Paul was given that he might "preach Him,” he declares to the Galatians, and he precedes his testimony, "Christ liveth in me," by the words "/ have been crucified with Christ" showing clearly that the revelation of the mystery of Christ living in us depends upon a true and real planting into His death.  
Once the believer perceives this focal point of Calvary in relation to his practical experience, all the truths of God fall into their place in beautiful harmony.  
No ideal of life is too high, since the believer has but to make way for the Lord Himself to fulfill the ideal through him. No command of God for service is too great, since the Christ Himself becomes all wisdom and power within him, as he by faith retires, so to speak, to the cross, and then moves forward to each service in reliance upon the indwelling Lord. The very energy of God comes into his life, and as he proves with joy the might of the risen Christ thus working through him, his whole outlook changes. "/ have been taught the secret... I can do all things in Him” (Philippians 4:12-13, C.H.), becomes the glad triumphant cry; "To me life is Christ" (Philippians 1:21, G.H.), the one increasing joy; "I will speak only of the works which Christ has wrought by me" (Romans 15:18, C.H.), the simple testimony; "I labor in earnest conflict according to His working which works in me with mighty power" (Colossians 1:29, C.H.), the energizing spirit of service day by day.  
Oh blessed life! How restful, how glad, how free, when once the secret is known, and the soul learns to live by faith in the Son of God.  
But, Paul, does this mean that you have become a machine with no personal choice or desires?  
"Crucified .. .yet I live" cries Paul. I am not a mummy, nor a machine! I am a human being with feelings and personal wishes, hopes and desires.  
I live all the more because I have died; for the sensibilities of this human organism, dulled by slavery to sin, have now become freed to become acute and living. Freed is my condition—not to be any longer the medium of self-sensitiveness, self-seeking or self-love but the quickened vehicle for the manifestation of the love and life of the Christ who now "liveth in me.”  
"Me"—Paul the Apostle—who am not worthy to be called an apostle, for I persecuted the Church of God.  
"Me" with all my own characteristics, temperament and tastes. All that goes to make up the personality of "me." Christ lives in me.  
Nevertheless I know it is no longer "I" that is the moving spring and center of my life. It is "not I" but the grace of God which enables me to labor more abundantly than all the other apostles. It is not my life but the life which flows from the living Christ who dwells within my heart, that is manifested through me.  
19
But Paul, is this a wonderful consciousness to you? Do you feel "dead," and do you realize great joy and heavenly ecstasy through the risen Lord thus dwelling in your heart?  
No, "that life which I now live in the flesh [body] I live in faith.”  
But what kind of faith, Paul? Is it by your faith that you have experienced death with Christ, and is this faith a great effort or strain every moment?  
No, it is "the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself up for me.”  
Ah, blessed proof of "I" being crucified with Christ! The "I" passes from the horizon of the soul's vision, and the Son of God, in the great love shown by His death on the cross, fills the whole heart and mind.  
"He gave Himself up for me" becomes the dominating thought of one's life, and all things are seen in the light and love of Calvary. Abandonment to the pierced hands of Him who died brings nothing but the sweetest joy; and, occupied with the object of love, one's faith in Him becomes a spontaneous, unconscious attitude of the soul. The believer no longer is concerned with his own experience or cares for anything on earth purely in relation to himself, but longs with deep desire that He who died should see the fruit resulting from His travail on Calvary's cross and be satisfied.  
The Way of Faith  
"I live in the faith of the Son of God."— Galatians 2:20, C.H.  
"Before whose eyes Jesus crucified was openly set forth. . . . Received ye the Spirit. .. by works ... or by ... faith?"—Galatians 3:1-2, mg.  
Paul says that the "outward life which still remains" (Galatians 2:20, C.H.) he lives "in the faith of the Son of God.” Even his own act of faith seems to have passed out of the range of his consciousness, by the assured knowledge of Christ living and working in him. The risen Lord, taking possession of the believer, brings with Him the "spirit of faith" and the act of moment-by-moment trust should eventually become as spontaneous and simple as breathing.  
But there are transition stages in the spiritual life—when the soul is being led into deeper knowledge of itself and its own powerlessness that it may know the abounding resources in the risen Lord. In such times of transition the believer has often to cling in an extremity of trial to the bare word of God that he is crucified with Christ. Fresh transactions with God will ofttimes be necessary, when he commits himself anew to Him and trusts Him to fulfill in him His highest pur-poses—times when he, so to speak, casts upon the Faithful God the responsibility of bringing him out through all the testings into the larger places of the life in Christ.  
We must, at all times, take heed in our dealings with God that our faith is always in the present tense. By this we mean that as we lay hold of His word that we were carried to the cross with the Crucified One, we should definitely believe that He "who quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things that are not as though they were" (Romans 4:17) does by His own creative word now communicate and maintain the life of Christ in us. With Jehovah, speaking is doing. He said at the creation of the world, "Let there be," and there was. The word of the cross from the mouth of God is as much the word of omnipotence as the word spoken at creation. Jehovah points to His Son upon the cross and speaks the word "crucified with Him"; the soul responds with "Amen, so be it." And by this the message of the cross becomes the power of God in all who thus believe.  
In times of transition also the believer is apt to turn from the way of faith to "works of law"—or self-effort. The turning back to "works of law" was the danger of the Galatian Christians. Possibly the first joyous experience of the Holy Spirit's work in them had passed away, and not understanding clearly the full purpose of Christ's death and the way of faith in the crucified and risen Lord, they were in a condition to fall an easy prey to those who sought to draw them back to the old life of reliance upon self and its doings.  
The Apostle's appeal to them shows clearly that the turning away of their vision from Calvary was the cause of their peril, and through his words we see also that the work of Christ on the cross must be the anchor of the soul along the whole course of the Christian life.  
"/ placarded Christ crucified before your eyes!" (Lightfoot). "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?" (Galatians 3:1), exclaims the Apostle, as he thinks of the way in which Jesus Christ was "openly set forth crucified" among them, for he surely had not proclaimed to them less than the full gospel he had preached to the Corinthians and the Romans. How they could forget such an unveiling of Christ's death and turn back upon themselves, he did not know.  
Who drew your eyes away from Calvary and all that it means? Who "fascinated you?” (Galatians 3:1, C.H.). Some subtle influence has come upon you. "Are you so foolish?" the Apostle cries. With their vision turned toward Him who died, they had received the Spirit by simply believing the "message of faith" (Galatians 3:2, mg.), and they had proved the "word of the cross" to be the energy of God, for God had supplied the Spirit bountifully to them, and even worked "miracles in" (Galatians 3:5, mg.) them, in response to their "hearing of faith" (Galatians 3:5).  
As Jesus Christ had thus been "painted large upon His cross to their very eyes," had they not learned the meaning of His death? Before the way of faith was revealed, they were "shut up in prison ... under the law" (Galatians 3:23,
20
C.H.) because they could not fulfill the law; but on the cross Christ redeemed them and became accursed for their sakes, so that in response to faith alone they might receive the Holy Spirit (Galatians 3:13-14) to work in them continually. Did they not know that they became children of God "through faith in Christ Jesus," and as many as had been "baptized into Christ" did "put on" Christ, that is, had "clothed" themselves with Christ? (Galatians 3:27, C.H.)?  
Were all their past sufferings in vain? Were they going back to be prison-bound souls under the whip of the law instead of entering in to all the privileges of sons of God? "l am again bearing the pangs of travail for you, till Christ be fully formed within you” (Galatians 4:19, C.H.), Paul cries in the anguish of his soul. "How senseless to go back from the simplicity of reliance upon Christ to reliance upon self and its doings. I can only attribute this to some evil power which has ensnared you, some specious influence which has drawn you away from Calvary.”  
Alas, such a subtle influence is at work today among the people of God, turning away their vision from Christ crucified!  
The adversary of souls knows how to "fascinate" and, insensibly to ourselves, to draw us away from the cross of Calvary. His devices are innumberable, and every stage of growth in the spiritual life is attacked by him with this particular snare; for every distortion of truth and working of error may be traced to the failure to keep Calvary, and its twofold message, as the central fact of the believer's life. This is the central truth from which every other aspect of the truth of God radiates. All other "lines of truth" must be allowed never to be carried to their extreme limit but kept within the radius of the cross.  
A continuous looking off to Jesus Christ crucified, and a steadfast dependence upon the Spirit of God to work in us the separating power of His death and to minister to us the quickening of His life, is the "way of faith" in which Christ can be "fully formed within" and the believer grow up unto the "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.”  
O soul, redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, if the "word of the cross" has come to you in the power of God, and you have consented to be crucified together with the Crucified One and truly united to Him as the risen Lord, take heed that you are. Day by day, turn your heart's vision toward the cross, praising the Triune God that you are there with the One who died, and then—
1) By faith in the working of God, commit to the death of the cross, without delay, any aspect of the old life revealed to you, counting upon the Holy Spirit to bear witness to the death of Christ by saving you from the accursed thing. Always respond promptly to anything that is shown to you as being not of God, during the whole course of your spiritual life, for His light will then shine upon your ways and you will see even your "comeliness" to be corruption as you walk in the light of God.  
2) By faith in the faithfulness of God live in the present moment alone, and, counting upon the Holy Spirit to communicate to you the life of Jesus, cast yourself upon His strength, and do the "next thing" that lies in your path of duty— believing that it is God who works in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. If you do miss step with your Lord, trust Him, by the skillfulness of His hands, to put you in step again, and do not whip yourself with vain regrets but continue in His love and leave yourself entirely in His keeping.  
3) By faith in the risen Christ walk on with Him, refusing all temptation to look within or turn back upon yourself at all. Let His word dwell in you richly, teaching you His will for your manner of life, and pour out your heart's longings to Him that He might show Himself through you to all around.  
4) By faith you stand. Be not high-minded, but fear. No past experience of His grace will avail you should you turn from simple dependence upon your Lord. You have no power but what you receive from Him hour by hour. You have a watchful foe, ready to ensnare you if you but give him place. Keep yourself safely hidden in your Lord who intercedes for you before the throne of God; for if you will walk in the light, bringing to the light your doings—that it may be shown to you whether they are "wrought in God" (John 3:21)—the blood of Jesus Christ His Son will keep cleansing you from all sin, and you shall walk in blessed fellowship with Him.  
"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not, for He is faithful that promised" (Hebrews 10:23). "If we are faithless, He abideth faithful; for He cannot deny Himself" (2 Timothy 2:13).  

<h3>CHAPTER 7</h3>
"He showed unto them His hands and His side. . . . He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit"—John 20:20-22.  
The Cross and the Holy Spirit  
"Christ redeemed us from the curse ... having become a curse for us ... that we might receive the promise of the Spirit."—Galatians 3:13-14.  
These words of the Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Galatians, show that the gift of the Holy Spirit is based upon the work of Christ on the cross of Calvary.  
The Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father (John 15:26), is sent by the Son to each of His redeemed ones for the special purpose of teaching them the things of God (John 14:26), for reminding them of the words of Christ, for always and only bearing witness to Christ (John 14:26), and for guiding each soul into all the truth. He speaks not of Himself, but communicates the mind of the Father and the Son to those of whom He has charge (John 16:13-14), unveiling to them the eternal purposes of God. He glorifies Christ in all His redeemed, taking of all His fullness and declaring it unto them.  
It was in the upper room in Jerusalem, on His resurrection day, that Jesus Himself came and stood in the midst of His disciples. Showing them His hands and His side with the marks of His cross upon them, "He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit" (John 20:19-22). Again after the Ascension, being "by the right hand of God exalted," He received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit and poured Him forth upon that waiting group on earth who had "with one accord" continued steadfastly in prayer, waiting for the "promise of the Father" which the Lord had said would come to them to equip them for the work, in cooperation with the Spirit, of witnessing to the death and resurrection of the Son of God.  
How the Spirit of God taught the disciples and illuminated to them the words of Christ; how He guided them into truth wholly foreign to their preconceived ideas and environment; how He bore witness to the Christ, and communicated the mind and will of Father and Son to the redeemed on earth; how He glorified the Christ and took of His fullness and declared it unto them—the book of the Acts of the Apostles sets forth.  
Through the Apostle Paul, faithfully taught by the Spirit, we learn that His dwelling in and possessing every believing soul is on the ground of Calvary alone. "Christ redeemed us" he writes, "that we might receive the . . . Spirit." The word "redeemed" takes us back to Calvary, where we were redeemed "with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood of Christ" (1 Peter 1:19). Not only so, but the Christ became a curse for us, that we might receive the Spirit! He redeemed us "having become accursed for our sakes (for it is written, 'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree') to the end. . . that through faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit" (Galatians 3:13-14, C.H.).  
The twofold message of Calvary is thus clearly linked with the gift of the Holy Spirit, for if Christ became a curse for us, then we are the accursed ones on whose behalf He hung upon a tree; and as our Representative, He carried us to the tree with Him.  
That the curse of the cross is associated with the promise of the Spirit is also deeply suggestive of the conditions upon which He can freely work in us. For it is only when we realize in very truth that we are "accursed" in all that we are in ourselves that we gladly accept the message of Calvary that we are crucified with Him who died on our behalf and make room for the full indwelling and outworking of the Holy Spirit.  
"The cross leads to the Spirit, and the Spirit back again to the cross” (Andrew Murray). Only through the death of Christ can the soul receive the Spirit; and only by the Holy Spirit, thus received, can the believer be vitally united with the death of Christ so as to know with assurance the indwelling of the risen Lord and be able to say with truth, "I have been crucified with Christ— Christ liveth in me!" Yet again it is true that only through a still deeper fellowship with Christ in His cross can we know the Holy Spirit in fullness and power.  
Paul's words to the Galatians illustrate this also, for he appeals to his preaching about Calvary as the ground of the Holy Spirit's work in them. And yet it is evident that although they had manifestly received the Spirit, they needed a clearer knowledge of the cross, for if they had seen their death with Christ as fully as Paul had done, they would not have been disposed to return to the old plane of self-effort. The Galatians had not realized the curse of the law which came upon every soul who failed even in one point of obedience to the law, and so they had not come to an end of all self-reliance. They had begun "in the Spirit" but did not know how to live "in the Spirit" on that very same ground of faith in the crucified Son of God which had brought Him into their lives at the beginning.  
It is urgent that Paul's words to the Galatian believers come with renewed emphasis today, for many of the children of God need a clearer vision of the cross of Calvary in relation to the Holy Spirit's working within the soul. For the Holy Spirit works upon the basis of Calvary alone, and the extent of the apprehension of all that the death of Christ means for those whom He redeemed is the extent of His possession of the individual believer.  
22
The cross leads to the Spirit! Through the atoning work of Christ, every yielded heart may receive the Holy Spirit; and in response to the surrender of the recipient does He take possession, "cleansing [the] heart by faith" (Acts 15:9).  
The Spirit leads to the cross! This is clearly outlined in the life of the Lord Christ. The heavens were opened and the Holy Spirit came upon Jesus at His baptism in Jordan, when (as a type) He entered the waters of death and chose to be identified with sinners; but this was not the real Calvary. It was "through the Eternal Spirit" who came upon Him at Jordan that Jesus also steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem and was enabled to drink the actual cup of death at Calvary. After the cross, by the Spirit of God He was quickened and raised from the dead, thus to receive at the right hand of the Father the anointing above His fellows.  
This is also the pattern for all who will follow in His steps. Through our surrender to God and the acceptance of the cross—typified by Jordan— the Holy Spirit gains possession of the citadel of the heart; and then He seeks to lead the believer into the real fellowship of the cross, working in steady progression from within to without, from center to circumference—dealing with new departments of the life, unveiling new needs and revealing the cross in aspect after aspect as the answer to those needs. He applies the death of Christ as the severing power from the old life and ministers the life of the risen Christ for the building up of the new creation.  
The believer may be said to be "filled" with the Spirit when he first receives the Spirit, but he is filled only to the extent of his capacity at the time. The capacity may be small, and it will remain small unless he apprehends that the Spirit leads to the cross, so that the capacity may be deepened and a greater fullness of the Holy Spirit be truly known.  
From faith to faith the Holy Spirit leads the trusting one as he cooperates with Him by a glad and ready "yes" to all His dealings, until, at the appearing of the Lord from heaven, the body of humiliation itself is transformed and made like unto His glorious body; or should physical death be the will of God for the redeemed one, the Holy Spirit ministers such abundant life in Christ that he does not "see death" but only falls asleep, to be "forever with the Lord." Mortality is then "swallowed up of life." “Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 5:4-5).  
Filled unto the Fullness of God
"He would grant you strength by the entrance of His Spirit into your inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ... and to know the love of Christ. . . that you may be filled therewith, even to the measure of the fullness of God."—Ephesians 3:16-19, C.H.  
These words sum up in brief the purpose of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer. Paul prays for the Ephesians that they may be "strengthened with power" through the Spirit, "that Christ may dwell" in their hearts by faith. The Eternal Spirit of the Father takes possession of the redeemed one for the express purpose of revealing the indwelling of the Son. He strengthens the believer for the fulfillment of the conditions necessary for the Christ to be fully formed within—the conditions we have already seen as explained in Paul's words to the Galatians, "I have been crucified with Christ—Christ liveth in me.”  
Faith on the part of the redeemed one is again mentioned here. Faith is nonexistent apart from its object. Faith is simply reliance upon the word of God, with the character of God at the back of His word! "Faith cometh by hearing" and is awakened in the receptive heart by the Spirit of God Himself as He speaks the word of God to the soul. "You were made partakers of His resurrection, through the faith wrought in you by God, who raised Him" (Colossians 2:12, C.H.), wrote Paul to the Colossians.  
We are therefore cast upon the Holy Spirit to supply to us all our need, including even the very faith by which we are to cooperate with Him and appropriate all that the Lord Christ has accomplished for us in His death on the cross.  
Unbelief is described by the Lord as sin, though we more often bewail it is as an "infirmity" which must be borne as an affliction by the poor soul under its power. But we must deal with unbelief as sin; confess it to God as sin; renounce it as sin; and expect deliverance from it through the death of Christ as much as from any acknowledged sin.  
Let us look once more to Calvary. We are crucified with Christ, therefore let us count upon Him as the living One to give us the "spirit of faith.” And then, ceasing from our own works in struggling to "believe," let us rest—lie down, so to speak—upon His word, and we shall be given a childlike, trustful confidence in Him and be taught to live in the faith of the Son of God, even as He lived by the Father.  
As Christ is thus revealed within the soul the Spirit of God leads the believer on, and he is made "strong to apprehend" with all saints the breadth, length, height and depth of the love of Christ. The supreme manifestation of that love was blazoned forth in His death on Calvary. "Strong to apprehend!" Divine strength is heeded, for the apprehending comes only by the sharing of His sufferings. The apprehending of another's sorrows with the mind alone does not create the fellowship that is engendered by walking the same path. "Ye shall indeed drink of My cup,” said the Master to His disciples.  
But to be "strong to apprehend" something of the love that led Christ to Calvary is not all.  
"That ye may be filled therewith" writes the Apostle. And to what extent, Paul? "Even to the measure of the fullness of God!”  
23
But this is beyond our power to grasp, O faithful Apostle of the Cross. Yes, but "He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask," or even "think"—for the mere conceptions of the mind have no place here! "According to the power that worketh in us" (Ephesians 3:20). We can be filled with the love of Christ—filled, and filled, and filled unto all the Fullness of God, yea, as when "the waters were risen, waters to swim in!" (Ezekiel 47:5).  
"Oh that I knew this blessed life!" may be the cry in the heart of some who read these words. Child of God, if you are vainly trying to realize the deliverance of Calvary without reliance upon the inworking Spirit of God, open your whole being to Him and commit yourself into His hands. Yield to Him to vitally unite you to the Crucified One, and to reveal within you the living Lord.  
Are you willing for implicit obedience to Him at any cost? Will you let Him have full right of way in your life? Are you now ready for the message of faith? Then once more turn to Calvary. As you look away to Him who died, dare to believe the written word of God that you have died with Him and God's wisdom in a mystery will be unveiled to you by the Eternal Spirit.  
"But what is the anointing of the Spirit?”  
Are you in the service of the King? As the Holy Spirit reveals the Christ in you, you shall understand that your Lord not only dwells in you but that you are a member of the Body of Christ; and as you are brought into your place in the Body, the holy oil which anointed the Christ above His fellows will flow down to the skirts of His garments, even upon and through you, anointing you for all service in the will of God.  
The Christ Himself will work through you mightily by the Holy Spirit as you abandon yourself to His will. But remember: "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit"; "diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all." "All [are the work of] ... the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as He will" (see 1 Corinthians 12:4-11).  
The Son of God was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows because He "loved righteousness and hated iniquity" (Hebrews 1:9). Even so will the Christ bring you into a deep hatred of sin and a love of all that pertains to the righteousness of God; you will love your Lord not only as a God of love but also as the God of terrible holiness. You will covet the severity of God upon all in yourself that is unlike Him and gladly be chastened that you may become a partaker of His holiness. So shall you become united in closer bonds to your Lord and a sharer in the anointing of Him whose scepter is a scepter of "rightness" or "straightness" (Hebrews 1:8, A.V., mg.).  
Knowing that you have given room to the Holy Spirit, now walk step by step in the Spirit, depending alone upon Him and seeking only His will and pleasure; so will He lead you on and teach you how to abide in your Lord, being adjusted into your place in His mystical Body. And you shall know that "the anointing which ye have received of Him abideth in you . . . the [very] anointing [which] teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in Him" (1 John 2:27, A.V.).  

<h3>CHAPTER 8</h3>
"Present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons... unto God."—Romans 6:13, mg.  
The Life Side of the Cross  
"One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him"—2 Corinthians 5:14-15.  
It has been well said that there are two sides to the cross: the earthward side, which means the negative deliverance by death, and the heavenward side, which tells of life in union with the living Lord. As the substitution of Christ for sin and the death with Christ to sin are, for all who believe in Him, indivisible, so death and life are not to be divided along the whole course of the Christian life.  
"If we have become united with Him by the likeness of His death,” writes Paul to the Romans, "we shall be also with Him in resurrection.” It is, as we have seen, the work of the Holy Spirit to make us really "partakers of a vital union” sharing "the reality of His death"—as real a union "as that of a graft with the tree into which it is grafted" (Romans 6:5, Conybeare note).  
What such a vital union means can only be known by the working of the Holy Spirit in response to a faith which rests upon the work of Christ on the cross of Calvary.  
The Holy Spirit will wield the "word of the cross," which is "living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword,” and with it pierce even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, revealing the thoughts and intents of the heart—separating the old from the new life, until the life which is from above has unhindered sway and the redeemed one truly lives on the life side of the cross.  
But we must remember that there is no "resurrection life" apart from the risen Lord. We are planted into "His death"; it is with Him that we were crucified, and to Him as the Living One we are joined so that in Him as our sphere we may walk in newness of life. The resurrection life is also a continuous one. It is not an experience which we passed through at some crisis long ago, but union with a living Christ—Himself the Resurrection—abiding in us and putting forth His mighty energy through us, so far as we fulfill the conditions which permit Him to do so.  
Moreover, life cannot be copied, and no assertion of possessing resurrection life can bring it into being. But no assertion of life is needed when it is present, for it is its own witness by its manifesting power.  
Thanks be to God, the life in union with Christ is real life, a dynamic power that is indisputable, bringing the soul into such living relationship with the risen Christ as to make it know something of the "powers of the age to come" and so to see the things of time from the standpoint of eternity as to lift it above the attractions and absorbing interests of things on the earth.  
On the resurrection side of the cross, the Holy Spirit illumines the cross of Calvary until "Jesus Christ crucified" becomes "placarded" before the eyes of the heart, and the soul is ever being taught fresh aspects of His death; for until deliverance from the bondage of sin is known, with the consequent cleansing of heart and life, the Lord is not given His place on the throne in the heart and the deeper lessons of Calvary cannot be imparted by the Holy Spirit.  
In 2 Corinthians 5:14 and subsequent verses, the Apostle Paul gives a word picture of the life on the resurrection side of the cross and clearly sets forth the death on Calvary as the basis for this new life from God.  
The Motive Power of the New Life  
"The love of Christ constraineth us."—Verse 14.  
The word "constraineth," which Paul uses, occurs several times in New Testament Greek to express a "grip" or constraint which is overpowering or irresistible. It is rendered "strait" in Philippians 1:23, and is the word used by the Lord Himself when He speaks of the baptism of suffering before Him and says He is "straitened" until it is accomplished (Luke 12:50).  
It is the word used in describing the grip of the "men that held Jesus" (Luke 22:63), and used again of the people "holden” with great fear at the presence of Christ and of Simon's wife's mother "holden” with a great fever.  
These instances, and their connection, give light upon the sense in which the word is used by Paul when speaking of the love of Christ constraining him. It keeps him in a "strait," hemmed in to one course from which there is no deviation. He is "held" by this great love; completely mastered by it, so that he is urged and impelled onward into one course like a torrent sweeping down everything that comes in its way.  
Such was certainly the love of Christ, for He who was on an equality with God counted it not a prize to be grasped but emptied Himself and humbled Himself to become, in the likeness of man, obedient unto death—even the death of the cross.  
25
And this love is the motive power of the new life in union with the living Lord: a love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit, a love which casts aside all self-love and self-interest and completely holds the soul in its power.  
The Basis of the New Life  
"One died for all, therefore all died."—Verse 14.  
As is his custom, Paul clearly shows the death of Christ to be the basis of the new life. In no other passage does he condense the twofold message of the cross into such a terse sentence. The Savior was the substitute for sinners—He "died for all"; and all for whom He died, died with Him—"therefore all died.”  
"The love of Christ constrains me," cries Paul, because I have been to Calvary, and in the death of the Man who died I have seen my death too. I have died with Him, and in fellowship with Him in His death all selfish barriers have been broken away. The love that led Jesus to Calvary is the love which has been shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit, and now it constrains me as it constrained Him and pressed Him onward to the cross.  
The Object of the New Life  
"He died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him who for their sakes died and rose again."—2 Corinthians 5:15.  
They who have "died" with Him now "live" in His life. They realize that it was "for their sakes" He died, "for their sakes" He lives; so for His sake they gladly consent no longer to live unto themselves but unto Him.  
They see that they have been crucified with Him, and now He who died and rose again fills their whole vision, constraining them to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, "holy, acceptable unto God," which is their glad and "reasonable sacrifice.”  
The Severing Power of the Cross  
"Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh."—Verse 16.  
In the light of the cross, Paul looks out at the world of men from a different standpoint to that which he held when as a Pharisee he walked in the streets of Jerusalem.  
Then he was a "Hebrew of Hebrews." He would have "no dealing with Samaritans." But all his exclusive caste-prejudice has passed away in the light of Calvary and because of his life in union with the risen Lord. "Henceforth I know no man after the flesh," cries Paul—for I live now in the sphere where all distinctions are done away, where there "can be neither Jew nor Greek . . . but all are one in Christ Jesus.”  
Paul is separated still from men, in truth, but not now with the exclusive holiness which said "Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou." Rather, he is separated unto God by the indwelling Presence of the Holy One Himself. Yet living unto God he is nearer to men, for he sees them as souls "for whom Christ died," and knows that there is "no distinction between Jew and Greek" in His sight, for "the same Lord is Lord of all" and is “rich unto all that call upon Him." He is separated by the cross from earth-born exclusive pride to be toward all men in Christ's stead, and, as was his Lord, the servant of all.  
Paul recognizes, however, the possibility of a knowledge of Christ "after the flesh," a state from which the cross severs by the power of the Holy Spirit. This knowledge of Christ is, so to speak, an exterior knowledge, even as the disciples knew Him before Calvary—knowing Him and yet not knowing Him as He really was within the veil of His human body.  
Even so today is it possible to know the historical Christ. His life, His death, His resurrection and ascension, all may be exterior facts, known to the mind but exercising no real power in the life. Participation with Christ's death changes all this, for on the life side of the cross the Holy Spirit reveals the risen Lord, and He is known "after the Spirit" as the Living One.  
The New Life in Christ  
"Wherefore if any man is in Christ, there is a new creation: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new."—Verse 17, mg.  
The "wherefore" in verses 16 and 17 both point back to verse 14. If any man is in Christ—baptized into His death—through the gateway of the cross he thus enters the sphere where Christ becomes his environment as well as his new source of life. Joined to the living Christ, for him old things pass away, for in Christ there is a new creation, not just a mending or improving of the old.  
26
On the life side of the cross the soul united to the living Christ is said to put on the "new man” (Colossians 3:10-11).  
By the daily supply of the Spirit of Jesus (Philippians 1:19) the "new man" "grows continually to a more perfect knowledge and likeness of his Creator" (Colossians 3:10-11, C.H.) and grows up "after the image of Him that created him,” in the sphere where "Christ is all and in all." A child naturally grows up in the likeness of his father, and the new life communicated to the redeemed grows up in the likeness of Him who is the Creator of the new creation—if that is, the death with Christ is inflinchingly recognized and "old things" are truly allowed to pass away to make room for the growth of the new man "which is after God . . . created in righteousness, and holiness of truth" (Ephesians 4:24, mg.).  
The New Service for Others  
"All things are of God who . . . placed in us the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ."—Verses 18-20, mg.  
It is to the new man in Christ—who clearly knows his separation unto God and meets no man any longer on earthly ground but in the name of Him who died for all—that God commits "the ministry of reconciliation." The alternative reading in the A.S.V. margin is suggestive, for it says that God places in His ambassadors the message of the cross—the "word of reconciliation.”  
It is written upon their hearts, wrought into their very beings, even as Ezekiel "ate the roll" before he spoke forth the very words of God to Israel. Even so are Christ's ambassadors prepared that they may truly speak on behalf of Christ "in God's stead.”  
Through them the "word of the cross" is manifestly the power of God, for they are "working together with Him” who through them entreats the souls for whom He died that they not "receive the grace of God in vain" but give heed to His call in this day of salvation.  
The Outward Life Depicted
"Giving no occasion of stumbling . . . but in everything commending ourselves."—2 Corinthians 6:3-4.  
As we have moved on from the basis of the new life, given in 5:14, we have seen depicted, in steady progression, the characteristics of this life which springs from Calvary and is lived in union with Him who died and rose again.  
"No longer unto self” is the fixed decision; "unto Him who for my sake died" the unvarying aim; "I see all souls as those for whom He died" the principle of action toward others; "old things have passed away" the continual attitude to the past; "He has placed in me the word of reconciliation," the constant responsibility to others; "I must work together with Him" the restraining and watching attitude day by day.  
"No longer unto self” is shown in vivid object lesson in the brief sketch of the Apostle's own life which follows (see 2 Corinthians 6:4-10). His outward circumstances meant afflictions, hardships, distresses, stripes, imprisonments, tumults, labors, watchings, fastings; but the new life was manifested in much patience, pureness, knowledge of God, longsuffering and kindness—a life truly lived "in the Holy Spirit," in genuine love, speaking the word of truth in the manifested power of God.  
Protected by the armor of righteousness on every side, Paul had lived this life through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report. He had been counted as a deceiver, and yet he was true; he was unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and yet, behold, he lived by the daily-renewed power of the life within him. He was chastened with keenest suffering, yet not killed—for the enemy could not touch his life. He was sorrowful over all the need of the dying world, yet was always rejoicing in Him whom he had learned to know. He was poor in every way, but making many rich with eternal treasure; having nothing in or for himself, yet possessing all things in Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
There is no room for living unto self in this pattern, O child of God. And so far as you are truly united to your Lord and made conformable to His death, you shall know in your measure this life which springs from Calvary—and walk even as Jesus walked, to the glory and praise of God.  
Measure thy life by loss instead of gain;
Not by the wine drunk, but the wine poured forth;
For love’s strength standeth in love's sacrifice—
And whoso suffers most hath most to give.  

<h3>CHAPTER 9</h3>
"Jesus... suffered without the gate. Let us there-fore go forth unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach"—Hebrews 13:12-13.  
Crucified to the World
"Far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which [whom, mg.] the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world."—Galatians 6:14.  
On the resurrection side of Calvary, the Apostle looks out upon the world and sees the cross once more in its separating power standing between him and the world. Viewing the light of God streaming down upon Calvary, he cries, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross.”  
The Apostle is driven to this outburst by the memory of some who were shirking persecution associated with the cross. The cross was an "offense" in a special way in the days of Paul, for it offered salvation full and free to all men, Jew or Gentile, apart from the external rite of circumcision. This meant the end of Judaism with its exclusiveness and its carnal commandments. The One who is in essence Spirit henceforth sought worshipers to worship Him in spirit and in truth, disciples who would offer Him spiritual sacrifices of praise in the spiritual temple of the heart (John 4:23-24).  
To preach such a gospel of necessity means offense, and the pleasing of Christ rather than men.  
No, more. "I have been crucified with Christ even to the religious world" cries Paul. "If I preach the cross as the Lord Christ has unveiled it to me, I see that His cross will be the instrument of my crucifixion as it was of His. In truth, I have already suffered the loss of all things, but God forbid that I should think at all of my sufferings for Christ; rather, let me glory in His sufferings for me. In the light of all that Calvary meant to Him, the offense of the cross is my proudest boast." Lightfoot puts it this way: "God forbid that I should glory in anything save in the cross of Christ. On that cross I have been crucified to the world, and the world had been crucified to me. Henceforth we are dead each to the other. In Christ Jesus, old things have passed away. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. All external distinctions have vanished. The new spiritual creation is all in all.”  
Such a view of Calvary as this is only to be known on the life side of the cross, when in the light of God it stands out in all its glory as the wisdom and power of God.  
In early days we shrink from the demands of the cross, for it only seems to speak of separation and death; but as the soul walks in intimate fellowship with the Living One, His death on Calvary becomes illuminated with heavenly light, and the vision grows more and more acute to see into the depths of the sufferings of Christ and the glories that shall follow, "which things angels desire to look into" (1 Peter 1:12).  
To Paul the cross is, as it were, a great gulf fixed between him and every phase of "this present evil world." Crucified with Christ, he is not only delivered from the tyranny of sin and the claims of the law, but from the world itself in all its aspects.  
The Lord Christ died "that He might deliver us out of this present evil age" (Galatians 1:4, mg.); on the cross delivering us "out of the power of darkness” (Colossians 1:13)—from the "world-rulers of this darkness" (Ephesians 6:12)—and translating us "into the kingdom of the Son." We are therefore crucified to the world, not simply "worldly" things or ways but to the world itself. And, crucified with Christ, we must expect the world to look upon us as it looked upon Him when He hung upon the tree. Nailed there with Him, we too must look at the world from the cross, and with the spirit of the crucified Jesus pray for those who are nailing us to that cross.  
That we may view the world in the light of the cross, let us once more go to the place called Calvary and see arrayed against the Holy One of God all the elements that go to make up this present evil world, and know what all who are united to Christ must expect if they are willing to suffer with Him that they may be also glorified with Him.  
"The soldiers when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments. . . . Let us ... cast lots."— John 19:23-24.  
In the four soldiers gambling at the foot of the cross we see that side of human nature which is callous to the sufferings of others and takes advantage of all who are in its power.  
Alas, what multitudes today are represented by the executioners of the Christ. They cry, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die," and have no thought beyond the physical needs of the moment.  
To souls who are responsive to the crucifixion and capable of feeling sensitively for others, what suffering it is to meet this element in this evil world. Alas for all who are in its power!  
"The chief priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, . . . Let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe."—Matthew 27:41-42.  
28
There is also a "religious" world which rejects the cross of Jesus: they who are not prepared to follow a crucified Lord; who "love the chief place" and the "chief seats," "and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi" (Matthew 23:6-7). They who "say and do not," and "all their works they do for to be seen of men" (Matthew 23:3-5). This religious world loves not the cross, even though in this twentieth century it bears the name of Him who died upon the cross! Love of power and the praise of men is contrary to the spirit of the cross.  
"They that passed by railed on Him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save Thyself, and come down from the cross."—Mark 15:29-30.  
The mixed multitude pass by the cross and join in the general cry. They are but sheep led as a flock by the leaders of men. They sense the mind of their leaders and are quickly swayed by the spirit of the hour. They pass by the cross and rail on the crucified One, casting in His teeth the words that He had spoken.  
Soldiers and thieves, rulers, chief priests, elders and scribes, with all the multitude, were of one mind that awful day. Religious men, rough soldiers, criminals and men of the world, all forgot the barriers that separated them and joined together at Calvary. One united cry came from their lips: "If” He was the Christ, "let Him save Himself.'' The cross appeared to them proof that he was NOT the Son of God. Let Him give supernatural signs and they would believe, they said. It was not too late to prove Himself the Messiah: "Let Him come down"—that was all!  
So it is today. All the elements of this present evil world become united at Calvary. The fleshly element, the wise of the world, the criminal classes and traditional religionists join with the special forces of the evil one in the great revolt against the cross. And once again they who stand by the cross of Jesus are a little band, the very preaching of the cross marking them out as "crucified to the world." The cross becomes the instrument of their crucifixion as it was of His. The cross once again manifests its severing power. There is no neutral ground at Calvary.  
Had we stood by the cross of Jesus that awful day, would we have cried "The offense of the cross shall be my proudest boast''? Will we now consent to take the cross and be ostracized by the world? Not only the worldly world—the world with its aims, its interests, its spirit of self-seeking, self-glorying and self-love—but even the religious world, in so far as the "elements of the world" are in it and it seeks to come between us and our Lord? "Jesus . . . suffered without the gate. Let us therefore go forth unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach" (Hebrews 13:12-13).  
The Elements of the World in the Christian Life  
"If ye died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world . . ?" —Colossians 2:20, mg.  
The Galatian believers were in danger of going back to reliance upon works of law for growth in their Christian experience, but the Colossians were being drawn aside from Christ in another way—through "philosophy" and "tradition of men"—which Paul plainly said was "after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.”  
To both Galatians and Colossians Paul had the same message—the message of Calvary.  
He would not add one more voice to the clamor in Colosse, for the Colossians were already perplexed enough with "precepts and doctrines of men"—various factions who were judging them in respect of "meat" and "drink" and feast days (Colossians 2:16). All these are external things which, under the old law, were a "shadow of the things to come” in Christ and are now of little importance. The Apostle takes them back to Calvary and asks, "If you died with Christ, why are you acting as if you were still living in the world?”  
Why do you go back to the "childish lessons of outward things" (Colossians 2:20, C.H.) and submit yourselves to the rule of others, who are "taking [their] stand upon the things . . . seen, vainly puffed up by [the] fleshly mind" (Coloss-ians 2:18, mg.), and not holding fast to Christ, who is the Head of His Body, the Church, and is the life of His members, so that His Body increases from within, by a spontaneous life which is the very "increase of God" (Colossians 2:19)?  
But if you have died with Christ, so that now you are joined to Him as your life, why go back to the ground of "Touch not" this or that? All these exterior things "perish with the using." "Food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better" (1 Corinthians 8:8).  
Paul admits that asceticism has a "show of wisdom," but it is, as far as commands from God go, a "self-chosen worship" (Colossians 2:23, C.H.). It has the appearance of "humility" and wise "severity to the body," but none of these things are "of any value against the indulgence of the flesh" (Colossians 2:23).  
Paul declares that the Colossians had died with Christ from all these elements of the world— elements which were "after the tradition of men," the outcome of "vain deceit" in men's minds. Why were they then imagining that by such observances they could conquer themselves? This was not following Christ. In Him was the true circumcision (Colossians 2:11)—the circumcision of the heart. They were buried with Him in His grave and quickened with Him to a new life; therefore they were not to act as if they were now "living in the world”  
Crucified with Christ, they were "raised together with Christ" and a heart belief of this would bring in a supernatural power—the power of Christ's resurrection. Instead of being occupied therefore with cutting off exterior things, and questioning whether they should do this or that, they should have been seeking the things above and setting their mind on the heavenly fullness which was theirs in Christ (Colossians 3:1-3).  
29
"For ye died,” repeats the Apostle, "and your life is hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3). They were severed from the old life to share the life of Christ; and through this life from God they could "make dead" their "members" (Colossians 3:5, mg.) and learn the secret of deliverance from the indulgence of the flesh.  
The dangers that assailed the Colossian believers are ours today, ofttimes under the name of holiness or consecration. So let us beware.  
Worldly Christians (what a contradiction of terms!) are not so liable to these special snares, but those who long to follow the Lord can be quickly influenced by the "precepts of men," especially those of men whom they esteem very highly in love for their work's sake.  
The cross of Christ is the message, and it is the remedy for all. Let us truly consent with all our hearts to be crucified with Him and it will not be long before we find that the world is crucified to us. It will have lost its power to attract or, in its religious aspect, to influence us in our walk before the Lord.  
All that is "in the world; the lust [desire] of the flesh, and the [desire] of the eyes, and the vainglory of life"—all that is "not of the Father, but is of the world" (1 John 2:16)—will be crucified to us, and we shall overcome the world, because greater is He that is in us than "he that is in the world" (1 John 4:4).  
The Cross as the Basis of Unity  
"We are made nigh in the blood of Christ. For He is our peace, who made both one ... and ... reconciled them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby."—Ephesians 2:13-16.  
If the cross of Calvary is the severing power between the child of God and the world, it is equally the uniting power between all who draw nigh to God through the precious blood.  
It is on the life side of the cross that the blood-bought children of God most clearly realize the oneness of all who are "in Christ Jesus." The message of Calvary is preached to the sinner as the ground of reconciliation with God, but it should also be emphatically proclaimed as the ground of unity between man and man, even between the professing followers of Christ.  
How sorely we need to see that all divisions between true children of God are part of those "elements of the world" to which they have died with the crucified Lord; and so far as we tolerate anything in our lives from which Christ died to deliver us, so far is there a "practical denial of the efficacy of Christ's death" (Lightfoot).  
Paul the Apostle, who had once been a member of the most exclusive caste of the Hebrews, clearly saw that the death of Christ had broken down all walls of partition between men who sought to worship the same Lord. And so, with the same intensity that he once sought to stamp out the followers of the despised Nazarene, he abandoned himself to the claims of the Crucified One and with no uncertain sound preached "the faith which he once destroyed" (Galatians 1:23, A.V.).  
The "word of the cross" revolutionized his life; it swept away his preconceived ideas, his national prejudices, his pride of race, his exclusive caste.  
The cross as the gateway into a new life is Paul's constant theme, and writing to the Colossians he impresses upon them that they have died with Him who died, henceforth to live in a new sphere where the distinctions and divisions of earth have no place—"where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all and in all" (Colossians 3:11).  
"In one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free" (1 Corinthians 12:13), he writes again to the Corinthians.  
The Jews called the Gentiles the "Uncircumcision," and the barrier between them consisted of this outward rite as well as the Mosaic law and the Levitical sacrifices—all ordained by God until Christ Himself would come as fulfillment of all these observances and as the one complete and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the people.  
Paul says that Christ "abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15), and Himself became the peace, for out of Jew and Gentile He would create of the twain "one new man." For Jew and Gentile, as Jew and Gentile, died with Him. If they draw nigh to God through Him, Jew and Gentile will be reconciled unto God and made into a new entity, the Body of Christ. So it was through His cross that He slew the enmity between them.  
Oh glorious message of Calvary, out of which the Christian Church has sprung, and all the blessings of freedom which we enjoy in the twentieth century; for through the cross of Calvary, so marvelously illumined to Paul the Apostle by the risen Lord Himself, and made clear by Paul's own faithful preaching of the cross, we Gentiles have become "fellow-heirs," "fellow-members," "fellow-partakers,” of the promise in Jesus Christ through the gospel (Ephesians 3:6).  
And yet even now in the professing Christian Church, called by the name of Christ, are to be seen many barriers between worshipers of God resembling those that stood between Jew and Gentile in the days of Paul!  
"He came and preached good tidings of peace" (Ephesians 2:17, mg.), writes Paul to the Ephesians. The Risen One, with the marks of His passion in His hands—He who died to create out of all the races of men "one new man"—comes Himself with the message of peace. Oh that He may come again to His people today with the same glad tidings, showing to us His hands and His side, and saying:
30
"Peace be unto you,”  
uniting all the sections of the living members of His Church, "THROUGH THE CROSS"!  

<h3>CHAPTER 10</h3>
"To this end was the Son of God manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil."—1 John 3:8.  
The Cross and the Powers of Darkness  
"He blotted out the handwriting of our debts ... affixed [it] to His cross. And, by yielding up His body, He showed contempt for principalities and authorities; and put them to shame, openly, in His own Person."—Colossians 2:14-15, Syriac Version.  
Another aspect of the work of Christ upon the cross of Calvary comes before us here. By His death He "despoiled the principalities and the powers," and "made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it [or, in Himself]," writes Paul to the Colossians.  
These principalities and powers are described in Ephesians 6:12 as the "world-rulers of this darkness," wicked spirits—or "spiritual hosts of wickedness"—in high or heavenly places.  
The victory of the cross was especially mentioned by Isaiah when he foretold that the Man of sorrows would "divide the spoil with the strong"; and now Paul the Apostle proclaims that on the cross the Lord Christ despoiled the principalities and powers and triumphed over them.  
Once again we notice the clear vision of all that was accomplished at Calvary and given to souls on the resurrection side of the cross. It is not until the believer apprehends his death with Christ as well as Christ's death for him that he actually passes into the sphere which Paul describes as the "heavenlies," where he lives "in the Spirit" and walks "after the Spirit.”  
In this sphere he realizes the actual existence of the forces of darkness described by the Apostle, for they are "spiritual" hosts unknown by those who walk "after the flesh," who are "yet carnal" and live "according to men" (1 Corinthians 3:3).  
It is therefore to the interest of the "world-rulers of this darkness" that the children of God should not understand the twofold message of Calvary through which they enter the sphere where their eyes are opened to the wiles of the devil, and where they see that their "wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the . . .spiritual hosts of wickedness" (Ephesians 6:12).  
It is true that the adversary of souls resists the message of the cross in every aspect, but all the powers of hell are aroused to prevent the believer's knowledge of the victory of Calvary over the prince of darkness and his evil hosts. On the earthward side of the cross, the subtle foe ofttimes persuades even true children of God that he does not exist at all. Or, going to the other extreme, he magnifies his power and holds them in slavery to habits of sin, deluding them into belief that there is no deliverance on this side of the grave.  
In their service for God many Christians are wielding carnal weapons, of no avail against the real foe. Others are filled with earnest plans and labor with heart and soul to win the masses to their Lord. But in both cases, behind and around them is the evil one and his real but unseen hosts of wickedness, who laugh at every weapon of the flesh and fear nothing but the power of the finished work of Christ when manifested by the Holy Spirit through men and women who have become in very truth crucified messengers of a crucified Lord.  
Since this is so, we do not marvel that the prince of darkness hates the cross, spares no effort to nullify its message, hides its full meaning from the children of God, and hesitates at nothing to keep them from knowing its power.  
Fully aware of the prophecy of Isaiah that the Man of Calvary would take "the prey from the terrible" and "divide the spoil with the strong" by pouring out His soul unto death, the "terrible one" himself came to the Christ of God when He walked on earth and tried his utmost to keep Him from the cross. In the wilderness he offered Him all the kingdoms of this world, without the necessity of going to the cross, if He would but bow down to him. But with His face set as flint to accomplish His Father's will, Christ answers, "It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God," and turns from the tempter toward the cross of shame.  
The temptation was renewed later through the lips of His disciple Peter when he urges the Master to "pity Himself," as he hears from Him of His prospective sufferings and death. "Get thee behind me, Satan," said the Lord. "Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men" (see Matthew 16:23).  
Satan is baffled once more, and leaves the Son of God "but for a season" before renewing his attacks again and again. He raged against Him through the demons who possessed the bodies of men, for all "wicked spirits" knew that this Holy One of God would end their authority and power over men.  
At last the final conflict is at hand. The adversary has failed to turn the Christ from the cross and now becomes the bitter instigator of it.  
The words of the Son of God as He drew nigh to the time of His sufferings show that He clearly knew the purpose of His death. It was to be not only "a ransom for all" but a final and complete triumph over the powers of hell. "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all men unto Myself" (John 12:31-
32
32, mg.), said the Lord to His disciples, foretelling the power that would be centered in Calvary to draw souls unto Himself, out of the death of sin and the captivity of the devil.  
At the supper table again the Lord said, "The prince of this world cometh, but he hath nothing in Me" (John 14:30-31). For He loved the Father, and as He gave Him commandment to go to the cross, even so He would do. He would lay down His life of His own free choice, to save the sheep from the wolf who had snatched them from their God.  
Failing utterly in his attempt to keep the Son of God from the cross, the prince of darkness enters into one of the Master's own disciples to lead Him to the cross.  
At the supper table the devil "put into the heart of Judas" (John 13:2) the awful thought of betraying Him; and after he had taken bread from the very hand of Christ, "then entered Satan into him," and he hastens away to fulfill the behests of the archenemy of his Lord.  
Oh solemn fact, that the spirit of evil must find human beings to carry out his plans even as the Holy Spirit of God seeks yielded hearts and lives to fulfill the counsels of God.  
"This is your hour, and the power of darkness" (Luke 22:53), said the Christ later, when, in the garden of Gethsemane, after His agony even unto blood, they seized Him and led Him to the judgment hall. From this moment He was given over to the world-rulers of this darkness, who were permitted to exercise their power upon Him to the full, and by the hands of wicked men through whom they worked their will, they "killed the Prince of life.”  
The Hour of Triumph  
"Having despoiled the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."—Colossians 2:15.  
This is the tragedy of Calvary described from the divine standpoint.  
At the moment when, before the eyes of the world, the prince of the world succeeded in putting to open shame and humiliation the Christ of God, triumphing over His body even unto death ... at that same moment, before God and the hosts of heaven, principalities and powers were themselves put to shame and triumphed over by the Christ they crucified!  
Paul says these evil forces were "displayed," "as a victor displays his captives or trophies in a triumphal procession" (Lightfoot). The Conqueror was, so to speak, "leading them in triumph" before the hosts of heaven. The metaphor used is similar to the one found in 2 Corinthians 2:14, but there Christ leads in triumph those who are conquered by His love and who gladly become the trophies of His death.  
What a picture is here before us of the victory of Calvary! What a contrast to the scene on earth is now presented! The mocking multitude around the cross little knew of the triumphal procession in the unseen realm, when all the hosts of evil were put to open shame by their Conqueror.  
The Apostle, in such a picture, places "the paradox of the crucifixion in the strongest light. . . . The convict's gibbet is the Victor's car" (Lightfoot).  
The Testimony of the Holy Spirit  
"The Comforter . . . will convict . . . of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged."—John 16:7-11.  
On the eve of His cross and passion, the Lord told His disciples of the coming of the Spirit of truth to dwell in them, to bear witness to Him and glorify Him.  
Before the cross the Lord had said, "Now is the prince of this world cast out," but after His death and resurrection the testimony of the Spirit would be "the prince of this world hath been judged" (John 16:11).  
The Son of God accomplished the victory over the powers of hell upon the cross of Calvary, and the Holy Spirit is given to convince the world of the victory and bear witness to the work of the Son of God.  
Yet how few of the children of God realize that, through the death on Calvary, the adversary of their souls is a conquered foe! How few know how to meet the wiles of the evil one, and yet fewer know how to attack him in aggressive warfare and participate in the triumphs of the cross!  
The Blood of the LamB  
"They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death."—Revelation 12:11.  
In this chapter of the Apocalypse, the veil is drawn aside for a moment to show the conflict in the unseen world.  
Whether it speaks prophetically of some special time in the future is immaterial for us now to consider. It is at least clear that, just as there was a final conflict on the cross between the Prince of life and the prince of darkness, when the latter was cast down from his place of authority over all who would trust in the Crucified One, so there will be a final
33
conflict in the heavens, when the hosts of the Lord will come forth to cast the dragon and his angels down to the earth, whence they will finally go into the pit and then into the lake of fire.  
But the dragon and his angels are still at large! Though the principalities and powers were conquered on the cross of Calvary, there is an interval between that glorious triumph and the time of their final casting down—an interval during which each redeemed soul must appropriate the victory of Calvary and individually overcome the conquered foe, and thus win the crown with those overcomers who will share the Victor's throne.  
In this unveiling of the final conflict in the heavens, we are shown the threefold secret of victory and the way in which each overcomer triumphs over the foe.  
"They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb." This takes us back to Calvary and the sufferings of the Christ. These overcomers had manifestly been taught by the Holy Spirit the victory of the cross; the blood—or death—of the Lamb was, therefore, the one weapon they used against the foe.  
This was accompanied by "the word of their testimony”—a fearless confession of Christ. "And they loved not their life even unto death"—they not only wielded the power of the cross for victory over the evil one but they had "drunk in" the spirit of Him who died and consequently lived the crucified life, triumphing over the prince of darkness through the Spirit of their Lord.  
The cross is the way of victory for all the children of God. United to the Lord in His death, they share His risen life and are seated with Him in the heavenlies, "far above all" the principalities and powers of hell.  
The Crucifixion
"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind."—1 Peter 4:1.  
The adversary may be a conquered foe; the power of the blood may be ready for us to wield in the hour of conflict; but unless we seek to know in ever deeper measure the inner spirit of the crucified Jesus, we shall still be powerless in the fight with the forces of evil attacking us.  
"Christ suffered in the flesh," writes the Apostle Peter, so "arm ye yourselves with the same mind." The Lord Jesus deliberately chose the path of suffering in this present evil world. He deliberately took the place of weakness, "becom-ing in the likeness of men" although He was Almighty; deliberately humbled Himself as a man by going to the lowest point of humiliation earth could find for Him, although in heaven He was on an equality with God; deliberately followed the path of obedience to God's will, even until it led Him to a cross of agony and shame. Step by step, lower and lower He went. The cross was no theory to Him! He suffered in the flesh.  
Oh child of God, arm yourself with the same mind. Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. If you will choose that the spirit of His death on the cross shall be imparted to you, you will "cease unto sins" (1 Peter 4:1, mg.) and no longer live according to the usual desires of the natural man but according to the contrary standpoint of the "will of God." It is true that others will "think it strange" and may "speak evil of you," but "if ye be reproached for ... Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part He is evil spoken of, but on your part He is glorified" (1 Peter 4:14, A.V.).  
We must be armed within by the inbreathed crucifixion spirit of Jesus if we are to triumph without, wield with certain victory the weapon of the "blood of the Lamb," and prove through personal experience that on Calvary the devil became a conquered foe.  
The Whole Armor of God
"Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. . . and, having overcome all, to stand."—Ephesians 6:11-13, mg.  
Paul here most vividly describes the enemy and the conflict into which we emerge on the resurrection side of Calvary.  
"Be made powerful in the Lord," writes Paul, "and in the strength of His might" (Ephesians 6:10, mg.). This presupposes that the believer has come to an end of his own might, for it is to those who have been "quickened with Christ" and "raised up with Him" and made to "sit with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:5-6)—thus putting on "the new man" (Ephesians 4:24)—that the Apostle writes.  
How are they to act in the hour of fierce temptation is the question in their hearts. They have been "crucified with Christ," and now, moment by moment living by His life, are they to fight? Or what are they to do?  
They are to be "powerful in the Lord" and strengthened by His might in them they are just to stand their ground! Stand against all the "wiles of the devil" (v. 11) to get them away from Calvary and their place "in the Lord.”  
"For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood" (v. 12), writes Paul. "Wrestling"—yes, the spiritual enemy attacks the spiritual man in a spiritual way, and the believer is conscious of a hand-to-hand conflict with some unseen foe, who, so to speak, winds himself around the inner man and "wrestles" in very truth. To "fight" is hopeless; the believer can only "stand firm" (Conybeare) and refuse at all costs to surrender his position in Christ or yield to the wiles of the devil.  
34
The reference to "flesh and blood" suggests that these "wiles" often come in human guise! But the soul strongly entrenched in the Lord is given acute vision to discern "the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience" (Ephesians 2:2), yes, but ofttimes also by means of servants of God—as we have seen he did through Peter to tempt the Son of God and when Satan moved David to act without the commands of God.  
Strengthened with power by the Holy Spirit in the inner man, the believer becomes a true warrior of God, increasingly able to recognize the principalities and powers as the "world-rulers of this darkness," and learns that the "prince of the power of the air" (Ephesians 2:2) has resources in the forces of the air to attack the child of God as he attacked Job, and is able to move men as tools to fulfill his will, even without their knowledge.  
"Wherefore, take up with you to the battle the whole armor of God" (Ephesians 6:13, Conybeare), cries the warrior Paul. The Christ has nullified these spiritual hosts of wickedness in His triumph at the cross, but you who are joined to Him must actively and ceaselessly "take up" the armor thus provided for you.  
Christ has not triumphed at the cost of His life to give you nothing to do, O child of God. You have your part in the conflict; you must overcome as He overcame if you are to share His Throne.  
When you learn the victory of Calvary and hasten out of yourself into Christ, host after host will come up against you and seek to draw you out from your Lord. That you may "withstand them in the evil day" (Conybeare) you must see to it that you have taken by the hand of faith every part of the armor of God.  
If you will put on the whole armor, you shall "withstand," and "having overthrown them all" (Conybeare)—all the spirits of evil that will swarm around you with innumerable wiles—you shall stand unshaken, victorious through the blood of the Lamb.  
The "whole armor" is the Lord Christ Himself. You dwell "in the Lord," and "in Him" you must "be made powerful" to meet all the hosts of hell.  
If you will abide in Him you must take heed to be "girt with the belt of truth" (Conybeare), for one shade of anything in your life that is contrary to truth, before the eyes of Him who is the Truth, will bring complete defeat at the hands of the foe.  
The breastplate of righteousness will be yours while you truly abide in Him who is your righteousness and do not allow anything in your life contrary to the righteousness of Him whose scepter is a scepter of uprightness indeed (Hebrews 1:8).  
"In the Lord" you must be a ready messenger of the glad tidings of peace, for you are "saved to serve," and you must with alacrity obey the promptings of the Spirit as you walk the earth or you will give occasion to your watchful foe.  
You must quickly take, and hide behind, the "shield of faith" from the "fiery darts of the evil one," and especially keep the "helmet of salvation" upon your head, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your "thoughts" should be corrupted from the "simplicity that is in Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:3). Above all, for defense and attack, you will ceaselessly need the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword.  
In intimate converse with your Lord, speaking to Him at "all seasons in the Spirit" (Ephesians 6:18), you shall be equipped to meet the foe, and be more than conqueror through Him who loves you.  
Knowing also the fierceness of the fight—and that when one member of the Body of Christ suffers, all suffer too—you will with "all perseverance" be pleading for "all saints," especially on the behalf of those who, like the warrior Paul, are in the front lines of the battle of the Lord.  
Then you shall be taught by Him how to "stand in the battle in the day of the Lord," and will be sent forth as an armed warrior, clothed in shining armor, in aggressive warfare to win the trophies of the cross, seeing signs and wonders done in the name of the crucified and risen Lord.  

<h3>CHAPTER 11</h3>
"If we died with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we endure, we shall also reign with Him.”—2 Timothy 2:11-12.  
The Cross and Its Continuity  
"That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowships of His sufferings, becoming conformed unto His death.” —Philippians 3:10.  
Once more we meet with the words "His death," and this time in the letter of Paul to his beloved Philippians.  
The epistle was written some six years after the letter to the Galatians, when Paul so exultingly cries, "I have been crucified with Christ." Yet here we find him speaking of an assimilation with, or conformity to, the death of Christ as the condition of knowing in greater power the efficacy of Christ's resurrection.  
In all the Scriptures we can find no clearer evidence of the continuity of the cross in the Christian life.  
Paul had clearly and unmistakably known the fullness of the Holy Spirit; he had been commissioned—and given his message of the cross—by direct revelation from Christ Himself; he had plainly preached deliverance from the bondage of sin through the cross; and in his letter to the Roman Christians he had explained the identity of the believer with the Lord in His death and the mighty, effectual working of the Spirit of life in Christ to make the believer free from the law of sin and death.  
Yet, with all this behind him as a message sealed by the power of the Holy Spirit and personally experienced in his own life, we still have the Apostle seeking to know more of "His death.”  
A manifestly deeper stratum of experience is revealed in Paul's words here, and they clearly show that fuller maturity in the spiritual life means deeper fellowship with the sufferings of Christ, for "the climax of the risen life gravitates, strange to say, back to the cross" (C. A. Fox).  
The Apostle therefore presses on toward "the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus" by eagerly desiring to be made conformable unto the death of his Lord, since he knew that to "suffer with Him" is also to be "glorified together" (Romans 8:17, A.V.) with Him.  
Let us turn to the letters of the Apostle and see in his own life what conformity to the cross means in actual experience.  
The Sentence of Death  
"Weighed down exceedingly.. . .”  
"Beyond our power. . . .”  
"Despaired even of life. . . .”  
"The sentence of death . . . that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead."—2 Corinthians 1:8-9.  
It is clear from this passage that however fully we may apprehend our death with Christ and know the power of His resurrection, we are brought again and again to a place where we realize, not only as an admitted principle but in actual fact, that we have no strength or resources of our own.  
"We despaired even of life," writes Paul, but we had the answer from God that it was "death within ourselves," so that we might be brought to such despair as to be compelled to cast ourselves upon Him who alone can raise the dead. He delivered us in our extreme need, and on Him we have set our hope that He will still deliver.  
This is the meaning of the many afflictions which befall the soul who has joyfully cried, "I have been crucified with Christ." We must learn how to prove the power of the God who raises the dead, by being brought to our wit's end and to place after place where circumstances are beyond our power and we are in utter despair of all help but in God.  
Since Paul the Apostle could thus write of himself after all he had known of God, to "trust in ourselves" is undoubtedly a danger to us all our life long; and to be kept at an end of ourselves is evidently a necessity for the manifestation of the resurrection power of Christ.  
Crucified Through Weakness  
"He was crucified through weakness ... we also are weak with Him"—2 Corinthians 13:4, mg.  
In these words we have another aspect of "being made conformable to His death.” The human weakness of Christ when He permitted Himself to be led as a lamb to the slaughter, as a victim weak and powerless in the hands of men, was to Paul a picture of his own weakness.  
36
He looks at the Son of God "crucified through weakness" and cries, "/ also am weak with Him”; but again he thinks of the Christ "raised by the glory of the Father," and remembering how He "lived through the power of God," rejoicingly knows that even in his weakness he, too, may share the life of Christ by the same mighty energizing power of God. And so he adds, "I shall live with Him by the power of God towards you.” I am weak in myself, cries Paul. I, too, am "crucified" by my weakness, but made conformable to the death of my Lord; so I count upon His life to work in me, and through me toward you Corinthians. In dealing with you I shall prove not my weakness but the divine power of Christ speaking in me. I am weak, it is true, but He is not weak through me; He is powerful in you.  
"Crucified through weakness" is then one aspect of the "being made conformable to His death." Yet how many think that they must feel power in themselves, or must become, so to speak, reservoirs of power or surcharged batteries of heavenly "dunamis"!  
We are sorely hindered by our human conceptions of these heavenly mysteries, yet the divine ideal of power is revealed in the silent suffering Man on the way to Calvary! "The weakness of God" is "stronger than men," but it is so contrary to the human conception of power that we need to have our eyes opened by the Holy Spirit to see the pattern. And we need the imparting of the same Spirit to even create in us the desire to be conformed to the likeness set before us, and then to fulfill it in us by the same power.  
"Conformity to His death" on the resurrection side of the cross means a deepening weakness in ourselves, not an increasing sense of strength! It is a weakness that is truly a crucifixion, because it is so contrary to our natural desire to feel we can do this or that. But to be kept consciously weak and yet to walk by faith, drawing upon the divine strength—by faith to act upon the power of God, by faith to count upon "Christ speaking in me," by faith to "live with Him" by the power of God toward others rather than toward ourselves—is a life of faith indeed.  
"Weakness, fear, and much trembling" in the believer, accompanied by the "demonstration of the Spirit and power" in the hearts and lives of others, is God's way of manifesting the life of Christ through those who are crucified with Him.  
The Dying Jesus  
"Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body."—2 Corinthians 4:10.  
Once more we get a glimpse of Paul's deep insight into Calvary and see how the death and risen life of Jesus is interwoven with all his thoughts, and is ever to him the basis of all advancement in the spiritual life.  
It is well always to place this passage by the side of the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, for one is the outcome of the other. 2 Corinthians 4:10 describes the subjective outcome of the objective sight of the work of Christ on Calvary, and without this subjective working in the believer of the "putting to death of Jesus" there cannot be the increasing manifestation in power of the life of Jesus through us in the world around.  
Many know the truth of identification with Christ in death and have seen themselves as crucified with Him, and in the joy of their fresh vision and faith they have gone forth to service in dependence upon the risen Lord. For a time there is the seal of God on their testimony, but gradually the life ceases to flow in power and their witness becomes hollow and empty as a tinkling cymbal— alas, too often unconsciously to themselves.  
What is the matter? They are living upon a past experience of the deliverance of the cross, and have failed to see that after the objective vision of Calvary and their identification with Christ in His death, death must still be the basis of ever-increasing life all the way; for "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus" is the unvarying condition for the continual manifestation of His life.  
What the "putting to death" (A.S.V. mg.) of Jesus in the experience of the child of God practically means, the context of the passage shows. The Christ upon His cross was pressed on every side, but not crushed in His power to endure; He was perplexed over the withdrawal of His Father's face, and cried, "Why hast Thou forsaken Me?" yet He was not in despair; He was pursued by all the forces of darkness, yet He was not forsaken by God, who sustained Him to the end; He was smitten down to death, yet not destroyed, for He lived by the power of God.  
Even so was Paul pressed, perplexed, pursued, and smitten down. But always true to the principle of the cross which had been revealed to him by Christ, he sees that in all his sufferings he was but "bearing about. . . the dying of Jesus" so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal body. He was kept at an end of all power in himself so that the power which energized him might wholly be of God.  
Thus does the All-wise Lord deal with His children to keep them truly dependent upon Him, and really empty vessels for His use. Thus does He press out all strength and power of their own to cause them to draw all their strength alone from Him.  
The Lord knows how to bring them into circumstances where only His life can carry them through; into places where the pressure on every side calls forth the boundless resources of God; where they walk in a maze of perplexity, but afterwards find how truly His skillful hands have guided them; where they are tossed to and fro in a stormy sea, but are not forsaken by God; where they are "smitten down," and apparently all things are against them, and yet find that the life of Jesus is manifested through them in its power of divine endurance, to the glory of His grace.  
37
Always Delivered to Death  
"For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh."—2 Corinthians 4:11.  
This verse seems at first sight to be simply a repetition of the previous one. But in "words which the Holy Spirit teacheth" every change of sentence has its meaning, and there is a difference here which seems to point to a still deeper conformity to death, this time for Jesus' sake.  
The concluding sentence of the paragraph which begins with verse 7 plainly tells us that at first "always bearing about the dying of Jesus" is for our own sake, that we may be kept at the point where we have no power of our own to draw upon and the exceeding greatness of the power may be proved to be of God and not from ourselves.  
But now the believer thus kept at an end of himself, and living by the life of Jesus manifested in the body of clay, is further, and deliberately, "delivered unto death for Jesus' sake." Delivered unto weakness upon weakness, trial after trial, perplexity after perplexity, conflict after conflict— all for the sake of Him who died that He might see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.  
Are we children of God willing for fellowship with our Lord to this extent? Have we not rather borne trial after trial in the hope that a point would come where we would realize nought but "glory to glory" in the spiritual life?  
But how little we have understood the law of sacrifice for fruitfulness. Joined to the Living One, we will be led on until the true light of life in Him dawns upon us and our clouded idea of divine things passes away. We need to see that we are in truth led from "glory to glory" in the light of His face that we may be enabled to bear still deeper fellowship with Him as the One who died, and fill up that which is lacking in the afflictions of Christ for His Church's sake (Colossians 1:24).  
Death Worketh for Life in Others  
"So then death worketh in us, but life in you"— 2 Corinthians 4:12.  
This is the outcome of being delivered to death for Jesus' sake. Death works in us for the fruit of life in others.  
We may desire to be used and to win souls, but is our desire strong enough for this? Strong enough to pour out our life for others and have nothing but emptiness and weakness for ourselves! This is real self-sacrifice; real selflessness; real self-effacement. This is the true spirit of the cross, and the true manifestation of the life of Jesus in mortal flesh; for this is the very love of Christ which impelled Him to Calvary, where He had nought but the death with all its unspeakable horror and shame that we might have the life from God through Him.  
There is only one way to really win souls, and this is the way of sacrifice. It cost the Christ His life on Calvary, and, in union with Him it must cost our lives also if we are to be the channels of His life to others.  
If we know the cross in its true inward power in the very depths of our being, so will the depths of other hearts be touched and the life-power work within them, for just so far as the death works in us, so far will the life quicken souls around—souls "for whom Christ died.”  
This is the apostolic life that each of the redeemed may know—the life of fruitfulness. This is the "fatherhood" referred to by Paul when he said, "In Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel." There are still "ten thousand tutors," but "not many fathers." Not many who are willing to know that conformity to death which brings the travail for souls, in fellowship with Him who travailed on Calvary's cross for us.  
"Death worketh in us,” writes Paul. It is remarkable that the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, with its full and glorious gospel of freedom by the Spirit of life in Christ, its unveiling of the gladness of access to the Father, its exposition of the witness of the indwelling Spirit and our heirship in union with Christ, concludes with a striking description of the conformity to death which is the outward accompaniment of it all.  
"For Thy sake we are killed all the day long. . . accounted as sheep for the slaughter" (Romans 8:36), cries Paul. But we are "more than conquerors through Him that loved us" is the triumphant testimony of the Apostle. Yes, Christ was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as we have chosen His cross and accounted ourselves as slaughtered with Him, should it be a disconcerting matter if others take the same view of us as we have taken of ourselves and account us as sheep for the slaughter too?  
Oh children of God, we may preach the cross, and even fight for the cross, but we render void our very message unless we are prepared to live the cross, and, in Paul's language, be ready to be "killed all the day long," that thereby death shall work in us and life in others, to the glory of Him who for our sakes died and rose again.  
"So then death worketh in us, but life in you," writes the Apostle. In us—emptiness, weakness, suffering, pressure, perplexity, but in you—LIFE.  
Even so, Father, for thus it seems good in Thy sight. Be it unto me according to Thy word.  

<h3>CHAPTER 12</h3>
"He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with Me in My throne, as I also overcame."— Revelation 3:21.  
The Call to the Cross  
"He that doth not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."—Matthew 10:38.  
Early in His ministry the Savior cried, "Take up your cross and follow Me," but He did not explain what taking the cross meant until He Himself had passed through death into the life beyond the tomb and ascended to His place on the right hand of the Majesty on high. From there, through His chosen vessel the Apostle Paul, He interprets His cross and its claims upon all who desire to follow Him.  
It is significant that Paul never says take your cross, but proclaims the cross of Christ as a cross which has already triumphed and bids the believer enter into the triumph of his Lord.  
The words of Paul interpret the call to the cross given by the Lamb on the way to the cross, and the words of the Christ interpret again the message of Paul. Although the cross has already triumphed and the work of deliverance and victory over the powers of hell is already accomplished, yet believers must individually accept the cross in its experiential aspect and deliberately choose to follow the Lamb in His path of the cross on earth.  
The call to the cross from the lips of Him who endured the cross still comes to each of His redeemed, and it foreshadows the only possible path in the present world for every follower of the Lamb.  
Five times in the Gospels is the Lord's call to the cross recorded, and each time it unveils a different aspect of the cross in the believer's life when the call is truly obeyed.  
Let us note first from the Master's words that—
The Path of the Cross Is Inevitable  
"Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after Me, cannot be My disciple."—Luke 14:27.  
The path of the cross was inevitable for the Christ. To Nicodemus He said that "as Moses lifted up the serpent. . . even so must the Son of Man be lifted up" (John 3:14), and to the disciples, that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer and be killed. The "must" was imperative. "Thus it must be," He said at another time. He must lay down His life for the sheep and must bring them back to His Father (John 10:16-18).  
But the path is the same for the Lamb and His followers. The "must" is as imperative for them as for Him, for did He not say that he who refuses to follow Him to the cross cannot be His disciple? Since the Christ took the cross in the sinner's stead to redeem him, he who would learn of Christ must take the cross of Christ or he cannot be taught by Him.  
Until that time when the Lord Jesus began to show unto His disciples the path that lay before Him, they did not know what following Him would involve. They had heard His initial call and had left all to follow Him, believing that He was the Christ—as Peter confessed one day—for they knew in their hearts that He spoke the words of eternal life. They had seen His mighty works and marveled at His grace. But a cross! Suffering and death? No such thought had come to them. "But while all were marveling at the things which He did, He said unto His disciples, Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men. But they understood not" (Luke 9:43-45).  
It is thus with many children of God today, but with a difference. They know that Christ has borne the cross and that they have life through His death, but that He bore a cross which must be their cross also has not been thought of by them. They have not realized that the crucified Lord must have crucified followers, and a true following of the Lamb can only be through death, for the Lamb can only go one way on earth—the way of being led to the slaughter. It is only in heaven that a throne is given to a slain Lamb.  
The Meaning of the Cross  
"If any man would come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."— Matthew 16:24.  
Let him deny himself! Not deny pleasant things to himself; nor even deny the sins of himself. But deny himself— and all that is bound up in himself— himself as the central source or cause of action; himself as the central object of all things which come to him from without!  
Himself! Any other word would have narrowed the Lord's meaning of the cross, for it covers the whole of the deliverance of Calvary, as was afterwards revealed by the risen Lord to the Apostle Paul.  
39
The crucial message of Calvary to man is salvation from "himself"! If he will take for himself the cross and, accepting the spirit of the cross as manifested in the Christ who died for him, deny—or renounce—himself as crucified on the cross with his Lord, he will in so doing be delivered from the bondage of his sins, the terror of the law, and the spirit of the world ... as well as the power of the devil.  
Oh blessed gospel of Calvary! How simple, how deep, how effective, how wise, for "himself” is the center and core of all the trouble, rebellion, selfishness, pride and sin! Let a man look at himself as nailed to the cross; day by day deny—or refuse to know—himself; and calmly, quietly, take the path of the cross, and he will follow the Lamb not only to Calvary but right to the center of heaven and share His throne.  
The Depth of the Cross  
"Deny himself, and take up his cross. . . . For whosoever would save his life [soul, mg.] shall lose it."—Matthew 16:24-25.  
Three times the Lord follows His call to the cross with mysterious words, unintelligible to the natural man and to the believer who walks "according to men." "Whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life ... shall save it" (Luke 9:24). Again, when speaking not of the cross but of the grain of wheat falling into the ground to die, the Lord uses almost the same mysterious words, this time saying, "He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25).  
We have been content with renouncing our sins and keeping ourselves! We have failed to see that "himself" in a man may stand as completely in the way of the Holy Spirit as one's sins, and still more we have failed to see that the life which flows in us from the source of the first Adam may hinder the manifestation of the life of Jesus in our mortal flesh.  
But what is this life which a man may seek to save and in so doing lose! What life is this which we are disposed to love instead of hate, and thereby suffer eternal loss?  
The margin of the A.S.V. gives the word "soul" for life in every passage we have referred to, and Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians throws light upon this when he writes, "The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." "The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second Man is of heaven" (1 Corinthians 15:45, 47).  
The life we are called to renounce, or hate, is the life which we receive from the first Adam. We may call it the soulish life to distinguish it from the heavenly life, which is given to us in union with the Lord from heaven. In another place the Lord describes it as a man's "own life"; therefore he loves it, for it is part of himself. We also love the soulish life because it works in the realm of the senses or consciousness, and has more affinity with the things of earth. The emotional, sensuous life is largely mingled with the true life from God in the early days of the child of God; hence the changing moods and "up and down" experiences of many, even when not convicted of definite disobedience or of yielding to any known sin. But to live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, and depend alone upon Him who is a life-giving Spirit, brings us into a realm of changeless peace infinitely beyond the pleasant emotions of the senses and the changing joys of earth.  
It is the work of the Holy Spirit to wield the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, and divide within us all that is soulish (Hebrews 4:12) from all that is true spirit. As the Word dwells in us richly and the dividing takes place, it is for us to hate the soul-life revealed and "lose" it by yielding it to the cross.  
If we would follow the Lamb and have His life manifested through us so that we truly walk in His steps in the midst of men, we must know the depth of His cross; and if we would enter into all the benefits of His death, we must on our part deny, renounce, hate, all our "own" to take of His.  
How far and how deep the renouncing goes determines how far and deep we know the power of His resurrection. We renounce our sins that we may die with Christ to those sins; we renounce the world and so die with Christ to the world; we renounce "I myself" and thereby give way to Christ Himself to reign within. And in like manner we renounce the soulish life from which springs all the activities of the life on earth, and "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus" we learn to draw upon the life of Jesus—that it may be manifested in our mortal flesh and, through us, quicken souls around.  
The Cross and Ties of Earth  
"He that loveth father or mother . . . son or daughter, more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he that doth not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for My sake shall find it."—Matthew 10:37-39.  
Here we have a glimpse into one of the many aspects of what taking the cross involves and what renouncing the soul-life means.  
40
The soulish life may be bound up in strong earth ties: lawful ties, yet held so tenaciously that they need the death of the cross and the deep working of the Holy Spirit to bring them to their right place "in the Lord." The keenest sword-work God has to do is the separating of soul and spirit in the relationships of earth, for the path of following the Lamb is scarcely possible without a point, sometime or other, where the claims of the Crucified One clash with ties of love. Then it is that "a man's foes" are "they of his own household," and loved hands are the ones that nail us to the cross. Then it is that the master whispers, "He that loveth" loved ones "more than Me is not worthy of Me,” and the obedient heart, with many tears, consents to follow the Lord, laying at His feet that wherein its life was bound; and losing all for His dear sake, finds all given back, transfigured by the joy of heaven.  
Was it no suffering to the Lord Himself when His kinsmen said He was beside Himself, and when they did not understand the necessity laid upon Him to fulfill His heavenly Father's will? He could do nothing other than obey the heavenly vision, although it meant a path contrary to the hopes of His friends.  
Thus must it be with every follower of the Lamb. But also with every step—if taken assuredly in obedience to God—the outcome will be as with the Pattern; for the day did come when His brethren believed on Him, and His word was fulfilled in His own case: "He that loseth . . .findeth.”  
The Cross and Confession of Christ  
"Take up his cross.... For whosoever shall lose his life [soul] for My sake and the gospel's shall save it."—Mark 8:34-35.  
The context of these words indicates that the soul-life may be strongly centered in a love of popularity and fear of men which would make the believer ashamed of Christ and of His words in a time when the sinful generation around oppose Him and the truth He spoke from the Father.  
"Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words . . . the Son of Man also shall be ashamed of him, when He cometh in the glory of His Father" (Mark 8:38), said the Lord in connection with His call to the cross as recorded by Mark, when He spoke of losing one's life for His sake and the gospel's. For nothing but taking the cross of Christ—renouncing "I myself" and the soulish life of earth—can so sever us from the world that we are not ashamed to be outside the camp, bearing His reproach.  
The Lord knew beforehand the "offense of the cross" and the offense of the message of the cross, for the gospel as revealed to Paul is the "word of the cross." To preach Jesus Christ as a "pattern Man" is no cross, for His Sermon on the Mount is admitted by the natural man to be unsurpassed by the words of any teacher ever known on earth. The archdeceiver of men will even encourage men to "copy the life" described by the Sermon on the Mount if they will but leave out the cross and the scorned Christ as the enabling power. Yea, even more, the devil will give the power to outwardly, and seemingly, obey the laws of the kingdom if thereby he can delude the soul into accepting a gospel that omits the atoning cross of Jesus Christ.  
To preach a gospel of the Christ and His cross—with peace coming only through the blood of the cross, and a cross that speaks of separation from the world and claims an absolute entire surrender to the Man of Calvary—will mean in truth a losing, a renouncing, of the soul-life; for in preaching such a gospel as this, the soulish life with its love for the glory of men is lost for the sake of the Christ and His gospel.  
The Cross Daily  
"Let him deny himself and take up his cross daily ... for whosoever would save his life [soul] shall lose it."—Luke 9:23-24.  
Just as the Apostle Paul said, "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus," so the Lord said, "daily.”  
We have seen in the writings of Paul that there is a union with Christ's death which admits us into a new sphere of life, from which we look back upon the cross as a gulf fixed between us and the past; and we have seen also a continuous conformity to the death of Christ, which is a necessary condition for the ever-increasing manifestation of the power of the resurrection in reality.  
In harmony with this after-revealed gospel to Paul, the Lord Christ bids His followers take the cross daily. Daily we must definitely account that we are crucified with Christ and arm ourselves with the mind of the crucified Jesus—becoming obedient unto death. Daily must there be the deliberate losing of the soulish life that we may exchange it for the life of the Lord Himself. Daily we must be willing to be led into fuller conformity to His death, not making for ourselves a cross but quickly yielding to "the cross in the way.”  
Daily! Daily! Daily! the Lord calls to the cross, if His children are truly to be His crucified messengers to a needy world.  
41
The Cross and Its Claims  
"If any man cometh unto Me, and hateth not his own father . . . mother . . . wife . . . children ... brethren . .. sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. . . . Whosoever doth not bear his own cross . . . cannot be My dis-ciple. . . . Whosoever he be of you that RENOUNCETH NOT all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple.”—Luke 14:26-27, 33.  
Unconditional surrender is the keynote of this entire passage, for the absolute claim of God, as Creator and Redeemer, upon all that we are and have is graphically put forth by the Creator-Redeemer Himself.  
Every word is significant and unqualified. Father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters, must each and all be yielded to the Redeemer, henceforth to be held in the Lord and for the Lord alone; and not only so, but the Redeemer claims the very life of the one He redeems, for the believer owes his life unto his Lord—he is not his own!  
Neither may he leave the cross to the Christ and think that he can escape it. He must bear his own cross—i.e., the cross of Jesus as it affects his own life—and follow the Lord in His path of the cross all the way. Moreover, the taking of the cross will without doubt lead him into places where he will learn that he has no resources in himself, and he will be compelled to "renounce all that he hath" (Luke 14:33) as of no avail to meet the forces brought against him by the terrible foe.  
"Renounce all that he hath" seems to be the summing up of the claims of the cross, the holocaust by which Christ purchased His redeemed. But let us not forget that the believer "renounces" his all only to be given "a hundredfold, now in this time" and "in the age to come eternal life" (Mark 10:29-30, mg.).  
In brief, we deny—or renounce—ourselves or else we deny the Lord who bought us. But if we have had the cross of Jesus unveiled to us in the power of the Spirit, our "own cross" will be lost sight of in His. We shall joyfully reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us by and by!  
The call to the cross is imperative; the claims of the cross are unqualified; the glory of the cross unspeakable! Shall we not heed the call?  

<h3>CHAPTER 13</h3>
"Hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away?"—Galatians 5:11.  
The Preaching of the Cross  
"I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."—1 Corinthians 2:2.  
There is a Spirit-given unveiling of Calvary and all that it meant to the Son of God and to a dying world which creates in the believer a passion begotten of the cross—a passion as a burning fire (Jeremiah 20:9) in the heart. It kindles an intense desire that the Man of Calvary should see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied, a desire that becomes the dominating power of the life and swallows up, so to speak, all personal thought of sacrifice or gain.  
Such a passion is revealed in the life and words of the Apostle Paul and is strikingly emphasized in his letter to the Corinthians when he writes that he determined to know nothing among them save "Jesus Christ and Him crucified.”  
What a complete self-effacement this determination meant to him we little understand today, for Christianity has glorified the cross. In Paul's time the cross was the "instrument of punishment of the vilest malefactors; it was associated with all that was most odious, contemptible and horrible . . . just as the word gibbet now" (Conybeare's note).  
Truly it took a revelation from God to make a haughty Pharisee glory in the cross and not to be ashamed of such a strange gospel. A criminal's gibbet the place of the world's salvation! No wonder they called him mad.  
Nevertheless "I determined,” he writes to the Corinthians, "not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ—and Him crucified”  
Corinth was highly cultured in intellect but dissolute in morals. It was occupied with philosophy and literature, but it was sunk in sin. Should he adapt his message to the Corinthians and win a hearing for the gospel by making use of human wisdom and knowledge? This must have been the question in the mind of Paul as he pondered over the condition of Corinth and its people.  
The Apostle might well have determined to meet the Corinthians with weapons of man's wisdom, for he had studied secular learning at Tarsus—by some considered a better school than Athens—and had been trained in all the Hebrew law in Jerusalem. Added to this, he was a Roman citizen and could have taken a position of authority and met the cultured Corinthians on their own ground in every point, had he so desired.  
Moreover he knew—the sensitive, clear-sighted man knew—all that they would say if he failed to take that reasonable approach. The message of the cross would be considered rank folly and he himself be counted but a fool!  
The Apostle foresees it all, and in the face of all deliberately elects to put aside reliance upon weapons of the flesh and determines to proclaim the obnoxious message of a crucified Messiah, casting himself entirely upon the Holy Spirit to make "the word of the cross" the power of God, so that all who believed would have their faith anchored not upon "persuasive [or enticing] words of man's wisdom" (1 Corinthians 2:4) but on the power of God alone.  
This decision of the Apostle shows us how absolutely he sinks himself for his message! How wholly he casts aside all personal self-glory! Such messengers of the cross are needed today, for in our century we find ourselves face to face with almost the same conditions as met the Apostle in cultured Corinth; and God's messengers have still to determine whether they will rely on carnal weapons and on "words which man's wisdom teaches,” or cast themselves on the power of God to bear witness to the message of the cross—a message still as obnoxious to the natural man as in the days of Paul.  
The Preaching of the Cross  
"And I, brethren, . . . came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom. . . . My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom."—1 Corinthians 2:1-4.  
The Apostle had been describing God's instruments for the fulfillment of His purposes in the world: foolish, weak, base, despised things, chosen to put to shame the wise and strong: yea, even "things that are not,” chosen by God to "bring to nought the things that are"!  
"And I, brethren," writes the Apostle—I came thus to you with no "enticing words," no "persuasive words of wisdom." As one whom men despised, "I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling," proclaiming the mystery of God; and to my message was given the witness of God in the "demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”  
Unless the proclamation of the cross is borne witness to by the Holy Spirit it may easily become a stumbling-block, for without the illuminating and convincing power of the Spirit behind the message, carnal reason may reject it to turn to "another gospel which is not another"; or the mental light about the cross may serve as an opiate of conscience, and blinded ones may even materialize the message and adore the outward symbol of the cross and rest on an exterior  
43
form. For the adversary of the cross knows well that he can hold souls in his servitude under cover of the "sign of the cross" unless they have learned the true meaning of the cross by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
Moreover, the "word of the cross" does not require persuasive words of man's wisdom for the manifestation of its power. The Apostle goes so far as to say that "wisdom of words" makes the cross "of none effect" (1 Corinthians 1:17, A.V.)!  
Does this explain the existence of so much knowledge about the death of Christ without vital changes in the lives of men?  
Can the cross be made void by the preacher? How awful the thought! The God-Man pours out His soul unto death for the eternal salvation of men and his messengers make the cross of "none effect"! God forbid!  
But how can the cross be "made void" by the "wisdom of words" of the preacher? It must be because "words which man's wisdom teaches" are definitely possible if the minister is occupied with his words rather than with the death of Him who died; for "wisdom of words" will surely draw attention to the messenger rather than to the message, to the oratory rather than to the theme, to the servant rather than to the Master.  
Reverently may we not say that the message of Calvary must be the most sacred theme to God the Father, and He will not give one shade of glory to men in the proclaiming of the death of His Son.  
The story of Calvary must be preached to a dying world in all its tragic awfulness, and "flowers of speech" as ill become the message as flowers around the cross if they had been strewn by those who watched the God-Man die. Moreover, the theme of the cross will not lend itself to rhetoric or poetic fancy. In brief, there is no place in the cross, either in its reality or its proclamation, for glory to the flesh.  
In Paul, as an object lesson, we see what conditions are necessary for the effectual preaching of the cross. The message of Calvary must be proclaimed by those who are willing to be crucified by the very preaching of the crucifixion of the Lord.  
The cross must be preached by those who know its power if it is to have the witness of the Holy Spirit and if the "word of the cross" is to be the energy of God to men. How the Spirit bore witness to the proclamation of the death and the resurrection of the Son of God we see in the Acts of the Apostles. The men who had stood by Calvary could preach Calvary. The men who had seen the risen Lord could witness to His resurrection. It was more than an historical fact to them, more than a doctrine or even a fundamental truth.  
"I feel as if Christ died yesterday!" said Martin Luther. It is the special office of the Holy Spirit today to unveil the death of Christ to the messengers of the cross so that it becomes as real to them as it was to the Apostles. Then He will be able to "placard" Christ crucified before the eyes of those to whom they are sent, and the passion begotten of the cross will cast out all thought of the praise or condemnation of men as with broken hearts the messengers proclaim the death of the Son of God as the only hope for dying men.  
Thus it was revealed to Paul, until he could only cry, "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel." Beholding Calvary from the standpoint of God, and Him who for the joy set before Him "endured the cross, despising the shame," all pride is swept away, and he elects to preach the cross even though the cross he preaches thereby becomes his own cross, and he, like his Lord, becomes despised and rejected by men.  
The Message of the Cross  
"The word of the cross . . is the power of God."— 1 Corinthians 1:18.  
The Greek word translated "power" in this passage is dunamis—the word from which we get the English word dynamite! The Apostle declares that "the word of the cross" is the dunamis, or energy, of God. The expression signifies not latent power, but power in action. In the cross of Calvary, God has centered His power to deliver a lost and ruined world, and "the word of the cross” is God's "power in action" to all who receive it, for it has Omnipotence behind it. "I, if I be lifted up," said the Lord Jesus, "will draw all men unto Myself.”  
But it is "the word of the cross"—not words about the cross—that is the energy of God. Not speculation as to what the cross means, but the pure and simple preaching of the cross of Christ as Paul preached it, taught by the risen Lord Himself.  
The servants of God need to face the question today whether they really believe that divine energy is in the message of the cross, or do we limit God and think that "the word of the cross" needs many words to explain it? Is it not the key devised by the All-wise Creator to unlock the hearts of men? "It fits me as a key fits into a lock," said one; and this is true of every human heart, be he heathen or so-called Christian.  
The message of the cross has Omnipotence behind it and in it, for it is the energy of God not only to the sinner burdened with his sins but "unto us which are being saved." It meets the soul at every point of life, at every stage of spiritual growth, in every cry of need, and is never inappropriate or exhausted. It is the power of God.  
Antagonism to the Cross  
44
"Many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ . . . who mind earthly things."—Philippians 3:18-19.  
These words describe those in whom the proclamation of the message of Calvary will arouse active antagonism so that they become its enemies. We must be ever aware that enmity to the cross really has its origin in the love of all that the cross proclaims deliverance from! They who love earthly things resent a message which offers deliverance from the things they love!  
It is true that the intellect is stumbled by the cross; yet the antagonism to the cross is mainly moral, both in the sinner and in the saved, for its message is only welcomed by those who desire freedom from the bondage of their sins and who hunger and thirst after the righteousness of God.  
Enemies of the cross! The minister aiming at "wisdom of words" makes the cross void as he proclaims it; those who cling to external things find it an "offense" in its message of freedom from the elements of the world; and those who love the things of earth are called its "enemies" for by their lives they place themselves in direct opposition to the very purpose of the cross. Oh solemn fact! Oh terrible thought! An enemy to Him who died to save me from myself, maybe while professedly His friend, perhaps while even a messenger of the cross—making void the message, not only by seeking glory for self in "wisdom of words" but by love of earthly things; for all self-indulgence is actually enmity to the cross of Christ.  
The Renewing of the Cross  
"They crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame."—Hebrews 6:6.  
Apart from the context of this passage, it is sufficient for us to notice the solemn words which declare that the Son of God can be crucified afresh, and this time by those whom He has redeemed and who have tasted of the life He came to give to all who obey His call.  
The Christ has passed beyond the power of the world and of the devil, and now only the blood-bought ones can re-crucify the Lamb. This is said of them when—having partaken of the Holy Spirit—they do despite to the Spirit of grace and choose to turn back to the "defilements of the world" from which they have escaped, and thus put the Lord who bought them to "open shame.”  
The warning comes in this passage of the Scripture about the responsibility of light. The Apostle Peter solemnly says it is better not to have known the way of righteousness than to turn from the holy commandment delivered (2 Peter 2:20-21).  
Oh that the Holy Spirit may so illumine the death on the cross to every child of God that the exceeding sinfulness of sin may be seen in the light of Calvary, and a resisting of sin, even unto death, be the mark of all the redeemed in these latter days, with the deep sense that, for those whom He has purchased with His own blood, all yielding to sin now is a "re-crucifixion, a re-binding, re-nailing, re-torturing, re-agonizing and re-killing" (Dean Vaughan) of the Son of God, who "suffered for sins once, the Righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18).  
"And one shall say unto Him, What are these wounds between Thine hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends" (Zechariah 13:6, mg.).  
Oh child of God, beware of the deceitfulness of sin. Take heed that you do not presume on the grace of God by yielding to the least temptation with the thought that you can be freely forgiven. See, too, that you do not call sin by the name of "infirmity" nor in any degree excuse yourself for failure. Since Christ has died there is full victory for you, but you must walk in godly fear before the Lord and touch not anything that is to you the unclean thing.  

<h3>CHAPTER 14</h3>
"By His own blood He entered in . . . having obtained eternal redemption for us."—Hebrews 9:12.  
The Lamb in the Midst of the Throne  
"Behold a door opened in heaven. . . ." "I saw in the midst of the throne... a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain."—Revelation 4:1, 5:6.  
In the Apocalypse we have an account, in panoramic form, of the "coming" or "appearing" of the Lord Jesus Christ in that day when He shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of His power, dealing in solemn judgment with all who have "obeyed not the gospel.”  
In the opening words of the book we are told that the revelation was given by God to His Son Jesus Christ for the express purpose of showing unto His servants "the things which must shortly come to pass," and that "He sent and signified them ... unto His servant John" (Revelation 1:1).  
The glorified Lord interpreted His cross to Paul that he might proclaim it as God's message of love to a dying world; but now He appears to the Apostle John and charges him to write all that he is shown. In this unveiling given to him we have vividly brought before us the heavenly view of Calvary, and the eternal consequences of rejecting the Lamb of God who died on the cross to bear away the sins of the world.  
The Apostle, addressing the "seven churches" in the name of the Triune God, speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ as the "Firstborn of the dead," taking us back to Calvary at the very beginning of his message. Those to whom John is writing are the loved ones of Jesus, loved and "loosed" from their sins by His own blood shed on the cross (Revelation 1:4-6); but He rose from the dead, the Firstborn of many brethren, and entered heaven as their forerunner within the veil. He is there as the representative of His redeemed ones, who through His death for them, and their death with Him, are called out of the race of the first Adam and are now of the royal race of heaven, "kings and priests unto God," heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.  
The Apostle John then describes his meeting with the glorified Man of Calvary when he was given the messages which he is about to transmit to the churches at the Lord's command. As he falls at the feet of Him whose eyes are as a flame of fire, he hears the voice he once knew so well on earth, saying, "Fear not; I am... the Living One; I became dead and behold, I am alive for evermore” (Revelation 1:17-18, mg.).  
This glorious Christ is the very same Jesus whom the Apostle had seen upon the cross of shame. The very hand that was pierced now touches him. The very body he had seen in the upper room at Jerusalem, when the risen Lord showed His disciples His hands and His side, is the same in the glory. His disciples had seen Him go up into heaven, but now heaven is opened and He who became dead is shown to be alive for evermore, with the keys of death and of Hades in His power.  
In the messages which follow, given to the Apostle for the churches, the Lord describes Himself tenderly to those in tribulation as He "who became dead, and lived again” (Revelation 2:8, mg.). As the One who had suffered, and triumphed in suffering, He bids them be "faithful unto death" that they also might receive their crown.  
In the messages addressed to those He "purchased with his own blood" a veil is again drawn over the glorious Lord. But then "a door" is "opened in heaven" (Revelation 4:1). The Apostle is taken up "in the Spirit" to the very heart of heaven, strengthened by the touch of the pierced hand of the Man of Calvary, to behold Him who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable! He sees the throne of "the Lord God, the Almighty," hears the "lightnings and voices and thunders proceeding out of the throne," and beholds the worship which day and night surrounds the throne of Him as Creator and Lord of all! The heavenly beings keep saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty. . . . Thou didst create all things, and because of Thy will they were created" (Revelation 4:8-11).  
In the hand of the Lord God the Creator is seen a "book." The cup of iniquity on earth is full to the brim. The Creator has determined that the fullness of time has come when the dispensation of grace must close and the era of judgment upon rebellious man must open.  
A proclamation is sounded throughout heaven, "Who is worthy to open the book?" Who is worthy to execute the eternal purposes of Him before whom angels veil their faces and cry, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts"? Not one is found worthy in heaven, not even the highest archangel of God.  
Then who shall open the book? To whom will the Most High God commit the solemn trust of dealing with a rebellious world, since no archangel in heaven is worthy?  
And suddenly John beholds in the very midst of the throne of God Himself "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain" (Revelation 5:6)!  
The Father "hath given all judgment unto the Son: that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father" (John 5:22-23). Only He who of His own accord laid down His life as a ransom for sinners is worthy, or fitted, to execute the judgment inevitable for all who "obey not the gospel" (2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).  
46
The Lamb standing in the midst of the throne is said to be "as though it had been slain." The sacrifice made on Calvary's cross is, as it were, ever fresh and new, enshrined in the heart of heaven and vividly kept before the eyes of all the company of heaven.  
The Lamb had "seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth" (Revelation 5:6). In the vision of the Creator's throne (4:5) the "seven Spirits" are seen as "before the throne," but it has pleased the Father that in His Christ should "all the fullness dwell"—"all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Consequently in the Lamb slain, as seen enthroned in heaven, is centered the fullness of the Holy Spirit, fullness of power, fullness of light and vision; and out of the slain Lamb, the Holy Spirit is "sent forth into all the earth,” for He is ever proceeding from the Father, through the Son, into the world of men, seeking to enter hearts which turn to Calvary in self-despair and loathing of sin. He is ready to apply to each the power of the death of the Son of God, and to possess each redeemed one on behalf of Him who purchased them with His own precious blood.  
The Lamb in Judgment  
"And He came and took the book."—Revelation 5:7, A.V.  
He—the One who had died on behalf of sinful men—He took the book into His own pierced hand, knowing all that it meant to those He had yearned to save.  
And the redeemed in heaven, gazing upon Him coming forth again as the Lamb to fulfill His Father's will, sang—
"Thou art worthy to take the Book... for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."—Revelation 5:9, A.V.  
And angels, ten thousand times ten thousand, took up the strain, saying, "Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain," while every created thing was heard saying, "Unto Him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever"!  
In this opening of the heavens to the Apostle John we see Calvary from the heavenly standpoint.  
The Lamb slain on earth is enthroned in heaven!  
The Crucified One is the Glorified One! He is glorified as the Lamb of Calvary, and as the Lamb all the worship of heaven centers around Him.  
All that is now unveiled of His work in heaven shows that all is based on His sacrifice upon the cross. He is in heaven as the Conqueror from Calvary; and as the Lamb who prevailed on the cross it is given to Him to open each seal preceding the awful judgments on the world which rejects Him. The Father commits all judgment into the hands of Him who became the propitiation for the sins of the world!  
From this we see something of the unspeakable heinousness of sin in the sight of the Holy God, and especially of the greater sin of rejecting or neglecting the sacrifice provided by God for the sins of the people. That the Lamb, who loved the sinner and died in his behalf, who suffered unparalleled sorrow and shame in giving His life as a ransom for many, should now have to open the era of judgment upon the sinful world shows the impossibility of sin being passed over by our righteous God. The Christ, by offering His life for sinners, obtained a "day of grace" for the sin-blighted earth, but now it is over, and He must abolish all contrary "rule, and all authority and power." "And when all things shall be subdued unto Him," then shall He deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father (see 1 Corinthians 15:24-28, A. V.).  
As the judgments fall, the terror-stricken souls on earth need none to tell them that the essence of their sin has been the rejection of the crucified Lamb of God, for they instinctively cry to the mountains and the rocks to be hidden not only from their Creator but from "the wrath of the Lamb.”  
Ah, who shall fathom the depth of the wrath of wounded love! The wrath of despised and rejected mercy?  
The Lamb as Leader  
"The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall guide them."—Revelation 7:17.  
The Lamb slain on earth and enthroned in heaven is not only the center of heaven's worship and the opener of the seals of judgments upon the earth, but we are given glimpse after glimpse of the Lamb as the Leader in heaven of the various companies of those He has redeemed from among men.  
The terror-stricken on earth know that they have wounded the Lamb, but the redeemed in heaven know that they are there because of Him.  
The first group of the redeemed, pictured in the "living creatures and the elders," do not hesitate to own that they have been "purchased unto God" (Revelation 5:8-9) with the blood of the Lamb, as they watch Him take the book and open the first six seals.  
47
Later we come upon another company described as "a great multitude, which no man could number," gathered "out of every nation, and of all tribes and peoples and tongues" (see Revelation 7:9-17). "They stand before the throne of God? and are said to "serve Him day and night." And He who sits on the throne spreads over them His "tabernacle," or the covering of His manifested Presence. These are those who have "washed their robes" in the blood of the Lamb. And He who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, Himself becomes their Shepherd, to lead them on unto ever-fresh fountains of water of life. Their sufferings are over, and God Himself wipes all tears from their eyes.  
Once more we see the Lamb standing at the head of another company, this time a definite number (Revelation 14:1-4). They are also described as those who have been "purchased out of the earth," "purchased from among men." And they "follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.”  
The Lamb as Warrior  
"These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them."—Revelation 17:14.  
Judgment after judgment has fallen upon the earth as the seals have been opened and the trumpets of woe sounded! The iniquity has waxed worse and worse, until even in heaven a voice from the four horns of the golden altar has cried to God for vengeance (Revelation 9:13-14).  
"The horns of the golden altar, in the Old Testament type, received the blood of the sacrifice offered on the brazen altar, and from the golden horns the voice of blood cried to God to spare, but now the voice cries for the letting loose of the powers of judgment.  
"The implication is that [on earth] God's appointed way of forgiveness has been set aside; that the divine system of gracious atonement, and salvation, has been rejected. Mankind in their guilt have blasphemously pronounced against God's plan of reconciliation, and the wickedness of earth has risen so high, especially in point of antagonism to the cross . . . that the altar itself, which otherwise cries only for mercy, is forced into a cry of vengeance" (Sciss).  
Picture after picture of the terrible doings of rebellious men, working as instruments of the satanic powers, follow, with glimpses of some who come "victorious" out of the sinful strife, until again we see the lamb as Leader, and this time of a host of warriors. The "abominations of the earth" have culminated in the mystery of Babylon the Great, drunken with the blood of the saints. The rebellion of the powers on earth seems to have come to a head, and is focused now "against the Lamb." But the Lamb who was slain on the cross is "Lord of Lords and King of Kings"! As the Conqueror from Calvary, He is sure of victory, and the warriors who are with Him in the last great warfare are those whom He has specially "called" and "chosen," and who are "faithful" (Revelation 17:14).  
After this final conflict between the Lamb and all that is against God and His Anointed, the voice of a great multitude in heaven, as the roar of many waters, is heard saying—  
"The Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth. Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come."—Revelation 19:6-7.  
The Christ who conquered on the cross, and waited while His purchased ones were being called out of all nations, has now finally triumphed and put down all authority and power under His feet.  
The hour is drawing nigh when the supreme purpose for which Christ Jesus gave His life is to be fulfilled. For He "loved the Church and gave Himself up for it... that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing" (Ephesians 5:25-27). Now it is "given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints" (Revelation 19:8).  
Once more the heaven opens (Revelation 19:11-12), and there comes forth the Man of Calvary with eyes as a "flame of fire," and the armies following Him are clothed in fine linen, white and pure. He comes forth to take final possession of the conquered earth, over which He now must reign. The devil is bound for the thousand years, and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ; and they who are the king-priests, redeemed from among men, "reign with Him the thousand years" (Revelation 20:1-6).  
After these things the Apostle gazes on into eternity, beyond the Judgment of the Great White Throne and the destruction of the last enemy— death. He is shown in vision the Bride-City coming down from God, "made ready as a bride adorned for her husband" (Revelation 21:2). The first heaven and the first earth have passed away! He who sits on the throne says, "Behold, I make all things new," and now "they are come to pass." Shall Calvary be forgotten? No! The name of Him who became dead, and lived again, is still
THE LAMB  
All other names revealing various aspects of Christ are now not needed in the full vision of His glory. They are merged in this name which is above every name—the name which unto the "ages of the ages" will keep ever fresh and clear before the company of heaven that marvelous hour in the annals of time when the Only Begotten of the Father.  
48
visited the earth, and on a cross laid down His life for those whose light is now "clear as crystal" and who shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.  
The names of the chosen apostles who continued with Him in His temptations on earth are engraved on the "foundations" of the Bride-City, for they laid the foundation of the Church as they proclaimed the word of the cross in the face of the scorn and rebellion of men. None are in the Bride-City save those whose names are written "in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8 and 21:27)—they who gloried in His cross and, accepting life through His death, were conformed to the image of the Lamb.  
"And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof. . . . The glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. . . ." (Revelation 21:22-23).  
"The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein; and His servants shall serve Him; and they shall see His face." (Revelation 22:3-4).

<h3>各各他和预示的十字架</h3>

「看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的」(约一29)。  
「到了一个地方名叫髑髅地，就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上」(路廿三33)。  
「希律和本丢彼拉多，外邦人和以色列民，果然在这城里聚集...成就你手和你旨意所预定必有的事」(徒四27~28)。  

各各他是世界历史的转捩点，一切在它之前的都是指向它，一切在它之后的都是归回它，一切未成的也都基于它，在天上那些蒙救赎的人所看见的，乃是在天上的中心，在宝座中间，「有羔羊站立，像是被杀过的」(启五6)。  

在基督耶稣被实际带到各各他的七百年前，借着以赛亚的预言，神的灵将各各他的亮光启示了出来，给我们看见十字架的道路、赎罪、受苦和果效。以赛亚清楚给我们看见，「基督按着神的定旨先见，被交于人」(徒二23)。因为「神曾藉众先知的口，预言基督将要受害」(徒三18)。并在各各他「借着无法之人的手，把祂钉在十字架上杀了。」  


<h4>神预示的羔羊</h4>  

「祂无佳形美容...也无美貌使我们羡慕祂。祂被藐视，被人厌弃；多受痛苦，常经忧患。祂被藐视，好象被人掩面不看一样...」(赛五十三2~3)。  

以赛亚五十三章一节说：「我们所传的，有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？」这些呼喊乃是先知从神那里听见信息之后所发出的，因这个信息实在超过人的思想和观念。这信息乃是向古时神的先知启示的，他们证明「基督先受苦难，后来得荣耀」(彼前一11~12)，好在末世的日子服事那些要听十字架信息的人；使徒彼得说，基督自己的灵在先知里面，证明在地上要有苦难临到祂。  

以赛亚所预先看到的基督，在父面前「生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地」。在神看，这嫩芽是极其宝贵的，他生的枝子必多结果实(赛十一1)。以色列本是蒙拣选的葡萄树，是父神所喜爱的，但如今祂所喜悦的葡萄园竟变成了干地，使祂这位天上的园主大失所望。然而在以色列家所发的枝子，就是为父所喜悦并多结果子的枝子。对于神，祂是神的义仆，「必被高举上升，且成为至高。」  

但对于人，祂是那位使人惊奇而向祂掩面的人，因为「祂的面貌比别人憔悴，祂的形容比世人枯槁」(赛五十二14)。因着荆棘的冠冕，这位圣者的脸面受了何等的毁伤，因着兵丁的鞭打，祂的身体遭到何等的伤痕。祂在人的眼中看来，「无佳形美容，也无美貌叫人羡慕，」因「祂是忧患子，常经困苦，」忧患和痛苦是不能吸引人的，所以人就拒绝并厌弃祂。 

先知以赛亚论到忧患子，说祂在受苦时的情景：「我并没有违背，也没有退后。人打我的背，我任他打；人拔我腮颊的胡须，我由他拔；人辱我、吐我，我并不掩面。主耶和华必帮助我，所以我不抱愧；我硬着脸面好象坚石」(赛五十5~7)。人虽向祂掩面，祂却不向人掩面。  


<h4>十字架的目的</h4>

「祂诚然担当我们的忧患，背负我们的痛苦...祂为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因祂受的刑罚我们得平安」(赛五十三4~5)。

<b>圣灵把基督受苦的原因和目的明显的说了出来，这位面貌憔悴者，诚然担当了别人的忧患和痛苦，祂受害乃是为他们的过犯，祂被压伤，乃是为他们的罪孽。</b>  

「我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路，耶和华使我们众人的罪孽，都归到祂身上」(赛五十三6)。我们看见祂受苦，以为祂「被神击打、苦待了」。但我们这些走迷、偏行己路的人，却不知道是耶和华将我们众人的罪孽都归到了祂身上。  

伊甸园堕落的结果，与十字架拯救的原因和目的，在此都显明了。罪的本质就是不信靠神，各人偏行己路，结果就形成了过犯和罪恶。「我们都...」是包括所有生在世上的人，「都归到...」是宣告基督乃是为所有在罪的咒诅之下的人赎罪。  

<h4>十字架的死</h4>

「祂...却自卑不开口；祂像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声...祂...从活人之地被剪除...谁知死的时候与财主同葬」(赛五十三7~9 小字)。  

现在以赛亚来描述这位顺服至死的受苦者，他看见祂像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，祂像一只无力的羊，被人捉弄。祂本与神同等，但祂不以自己与神同等为强夺的，反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形像，成为人的样式，自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，在人的手中像一只祭牲，甘心「被牵到宰杀之地」。基督在彼拉多面前「被...控告的时候，甚么都不回答」(太廿七12)，所以巡抚甚为诧异。「因受欺压和审判，祂被夺去，」结果死在城外的各各他。  

这位忧患子预先知道，祂每一步都是照着经上的话而行。当祂末次面向耶路撒冷而去时，祂说：「先知所写的一切事，都要成就在人子身上。祂将要被交给外邦人，他们要戏弄祂、凌辱祂，吐唾沫在祂脸上，并要鞭打祂、杀害祂」(路十八31~32)。  

当犹大出卖祂，门徒离弃祂时，祂说这些都早已写在经上了；当祂从死里复活之后，祂提醒门徒说，这就是祂从前与他们同在时所告诉他们的：「摩西的律法，先知的书和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话都必须应验」(路廿四44)。好叫他们对于祂的十字架有所准备。  

以赛亚不只预言基督的受苦和受死，并且也预言到祂的埋葬。祂虽被人厌弃，并与恶人同死，但却「与财主同葬」。这些预言句句都应验了。神为着祂的旨意，预备了一个器皿──亚利马太的约瑟(可十五34)，是个尊贵的议士，素来等候神国的，也是主耶稣一个隐藏的门徒──来应验祂的话。当主耶稣死后，约瑟放胆进去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体，并且恭敬的安放在他的新坟墓里。  

<h4>神所预备的羔羊</h4>

「耶和华却喜悦将祂压伤，使祂受痛苦；祂献自己为赎罪祭」(赛五十三10 小字)。  

亚伯拉罕在摩利亚山上曾对以撒说：「神必自己预备作燔祭的羊羔」。以赛亚亦预言神为祂自己所预备的羊羔，在日期满足的时候，必启示出来。现在我们很清楚的看见，祂乃是那位把自己献为赎罪祭，也就是神吩咐以色列人天天都要献的赎罪祭所预表的。直到如今，一切带着祭物敬拜神的人，神已为他们预备了羊羔，并把他们的罪都归在祂身上，他们并不再需要献祭，而只要接受神为他们预备的就好了。那位在父面前生长如嫩芽的，现在耶和华却定意(或喜悦)将祂压伤，使祂受痛苦。在这段经文里，我们从父的眼中看见了各各他，父爱世人，甚至将祂的独生子，毫不吝惜的为我们众人舍了。  

<h4>十字架的功效</h4>

「祂必看见后裔，并且延长年日...祂必看见自己劳苦(生产之苦)的功效，便心满意足」(赛五十三10~11)。  

从这些话里我们可以看见十字架另一面的光景。各各他与神的法则──牺牲乃为多结果子──乃是相和谐的。基督被压伤受痛苦，得到了祂的后裔，就借着祂的后裔延长了祂的年日，并且当神得着了有祂自己形像的果子，神所喜悦的就在祂手中亨通了。  

<b>创造者渴望能得着一班人，像祂并与祂有交通</b>；这是在神心意和性情中启示出来的最大奥秘。三而一的神说：「我们要照着我们的形像，按着我们的样式造人」(创一26)。虽然当时借着祂的话所造出的美丽的大地已摆在祂面前，但在地上还没有合祂心意的人。痛于首次创造的堕落，为要使走迷的人得到重生，为着一个新族类的诞生，在各各他祂将命倾倒，好叫他们各人从自己的道路回转过来，因着祂的死，使许人的罪得赦，而被称义；祂看见自己劳苦的功效，便心满意足。首先的亚当堕落的子孙，所以能够重生，乃是因着主耶稣十字架的功效；当祂在地上初次传道时，祂对尼哥底母说，罪人必须要重生，人子必须被举起来，成为永生的泉源(约三14~16)。

<h4>十字架的得胜</h4>
「所以我要使祂与位大的同分，与强盛的均分掳物」(赛五十三12)。  

这里又说出十字架另一面的光景。此处提到有一位称为「位大的」──这暗示有一个争战──主耶稣要在争战中胜过它而分得掳物。以赛亚曾说到「勇士抢去的」和「该掳掠的」，都可从壮士那里拯救回来(赛四十九24~25)。各各他不只为担当我们的罪，使我们得医治，使我们得称为义；不仅产生一个新人，与神的儿子完全相似；并且也是一个争战，使那些被仇敌所掳的人，从仇敌的能力之下拯救出来。这记载与别处的圣经也相符合，大卫在异象中看见升天的主，「掳掠了那掳掠者」，进入至高的圣所；写希伯来书信的使徒得着默示，说到「祂借着死，败坏了那掌死权的，就是魔鬼」，为要「拯救那些一生因怕死而为奴仆的人」(来二15)。

这里又记着说，祂所以能与强盛的均分掳物，因为「祂也被列在罪犯之中」。祂因为完全顺服父的旨意，接受并喝了那受苦与受死的杯。各各他的用意可以启示给我们基督胜过那壮士的原因，魔鬼想要高举自己至高者同等，但神的儿子却降卑自己，甘心卑微，降为至卑，所以神将祂升为至高，赐给祂那超乎万名之上的名；因为各各他在地上虽是羞辱，在天上却是高升。  

<h4>十字架在天上的功效</h4>

「祂却担当多人的罪，又为罪犯代求」(赛五十三12)。  

在这一句简短的话语中，我们能看见进入天上幔内的各各他的得胜者，为着祂所代死的人在神面前祈求(来九24)。「祂也被列在罪犯之中」，所以祂能为罪犯代求，祂能感觉他们的忧苦。祂在地上自己也曾在凡事上受过试探，只是没有犯罪(来二18；四15)。

<h4>结论</h4>

让我们去各各他，在以赛亚的预言所启示出来的亮光里，来看那位为着摆在祂面前的喜乐，就忍受十字架，轻看羞辱的人子；到了时候，祂就来到这个世界，当这位神而人者低下头来，将祂的灵魂交在父手中时，我们听见祂呼喊说：「成了！」我们知道祂是父所预备的羔羊，为着要献上赎罪祭；那位面貌比别人憔悴的神子，为我们的罪受害压伤，所以因祂受的鞭伤，我们便得了医治。  

过了一些时候，在五旬节以后，有一位有权位的人，坐车经过旷野，读到以赛亚的预言，当他读到：「祂像羔羊被牵到宰杀之地」，「祂从活人之地被剪除」的时候，圣灵就借着一个名叫腓利的门徒，把以赛亚所说的十字架指示他(徒八26~35)。今天圣灵仍借着被祂教导过的人，将这信息传给每一个寻求祂的人。  

因此圣灵就见证说，<b>以赛亚确曾预先看见了神的基督</b>，「以赛亚因为看见祂的荣耀，就指着祂说这话」(约十二41)。

<h3>升天的基督所传述的十字架</h3>   

「真理的圣灵来了...祂要荣耀我，因为祂要将受于我的，告诉你们」(约十六13~14)。   

「我...所传的福音，不是出于人的意思。因为我不是从人领受的，也不是人教导我的，乃是从耶稣基督启示来的」(加一11~12)。  

我们曾看过使徒彼得的话说，基督的灵曾在古时众先知里面预先证明，基督必先受害，以后要得荣耀。这一个见证启示出神的儿子，不只当祂的时候来到时要死于十字架，并且从创世以来也作了预言的灵，论到祂的自己。当祂显明在世人面前数世纪之先，就已借着圣灵感动那些先知们来传讲祂那要来的十字架。在祂受难之前是这样，所以在祂死后也不能立即升天，好将宣告传述祂十字架的工作完全交托给人的智慧。

使徒虽曾亲眼看见过祂的受苦，但主并没有任凭他们去传述各人自己所认识的十字架，因为在五旬节那天，在那间楼房里，我们看见可称颂之三而一神位中的第三位──从父所差来的真理的灵──是怎样为着传十字架信息的工作，来支配并装备了这班蒙拣选的见证人。

圣灵是父给予祂儿子在地上所救赎的人的恩赐，是从祂而来，为钉十字架的那位作见证，并且借着祂的门徒，见证祂的死而复活。「圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力...作我的见证」。这是复活的
主说的。现在我们看见那些蒙拣选的见证人，从圣灵得着能力，见证主耶稣的死和复活。彼得说：「你们把祂钉在十字架上杀了」，但「神叫祂复活」。「你们钉在十字架上的这位耶稣，神已经立祂为主为基督了」。「你们弃绝了那圣洁公义者，反求着释放一个凶手给你们；你们杀了那生命的主，神却叫祂从死里复活了」(徒二23~24，36；三14~15)。  

这是由圣灵所产生的见证人的信息，也是借着钉十字架复活神儿子的名所行的神迹奇事所见证的。  

特别是司提反，「满有恩惠能力，在民间行了大奇事和神迹」，在犹太人公会面前，为钉十字架的耶稣作见证，并且为使此见证完满达成，最后他竟为那替他死的主倾倒了自己的生命。<b>十字架的果效，藉司提反的死，厉害的彰显了出来，因为从他的死，产生出一位有能力传讲神儿子牺牲的丰满意义的人来。</b>  

从司提反之死和法利赛人扫罗回转悔改的结果，我们就能确实地认识<b>十字架的信息乃是神的大能</b>；因十字架的道是圣灵传述的，十字架的灵就授予了传道者，这就能在别人身上产生出十字架的果效。或者这样说，法利赛人扫罗在殉道者司提反身上，亲眼看见了主耶稣的受难，当他听见将死的司提反祷告说：「主啊！不要将这罪归于他们」，他好象听到主在十字架上为那些钉祂的人祷告：「父啊！赦免他们，因为他们所作的，他们不知道」一样。我们深信那天犹如有一枝利箭，刺入扫罗的心，并且当他在往大马色的路上，升天的主忽然遇见他，并且听见主说：「扫罗，扫罗，你为甚么逼迫我？」「你用脚踢刺是难的」的时候，扫罗知道他已在殉道者司提反身上看见了基督的灵，因此这一个「蒙拣选的器皿」，就不能不俯伏在主的脚前被主得着了。   

先知以赛亚是蒙神拣选并装备的器皿，来预言十字架奇妙的故事，并且用极其精细的文笔，描写出神羔羊的性质。保罗也同样是蒙主拣选，接受并传讲十字架信息的人。  

以赛亚和保罗都是为着他们特别的职事，亲身被神遇着；当遇见神时，他们都憎恶自己，以赛亚喊说：「祸哉，我灭亡了」；使徒说：「在我里面没有良善」。并且二人都完全的降服于神，以赛亚说：「我在这里，请差遣我」；保罗说：「主啊！我当作甚么？」以赛亚为着他的同胞痛哭(赛廿二4)，保罗为着以色列人的昏昧，魂里忧伤；也都是表示他们二人为着事奉神，深受痛苦，并且为着事奉神而舍弃了一切。他们二人也都有属灵的度量，来接受并传述神圣灵的教训。<b>他们二人也都被托来传述各各他的信息，一是关于各各他的胚芽，一是其丰满的结果。他们二人也都被基督自己的灵所默示，一个是预先见证祂的受苦，一个是阐述祂受死荣耀的结果</b>。

因此保罗着重的宣告，他所传的福音，「不是出于人，也不是从人领受的」──甚至也不是从任何一个亲眼见过基督受苦之人领受的──「也不是人教导我的，乃是从耶稣基督启示来的」。他写信给加拉太人说：「你们从我所听见的这信息，乃是出于神的纯正，是从宝座来的...是复活的主亲自向我揭示的」(加一11~24 另译)。我们并不感觉惊奇。

因此我们知道这一个令人悲哀并感到严肃的事实，就是复活升天的主，带着祂有受苦标记的身体，升上了高天，亲自将祂<b>受死的目的</b>讲述给保罗。如果我们将此谨记在心，来默想在保罗文字中所有关于各各他的信息时，「十字架的道」对我们将实际的成为「神的大能」。保罗所传十字架的福音，是直接从主自己来的，这也可以从他上耶路撒冷去，见那些为首的基督的使徒所得的后果，得到证明。保罗「是奉启示上去的」，为要把他在外邦人中所传的福音，对众使徒们陈说，并且当他这样作了之后，他发现自己从复活的主那里是那样丰满的获得了教导，以致那些看见基督受死，并在祂从死里复活之后，与祂说话的人，以及在五旬节的日子被圣灵充满的人，对于这位蒙主拣选、宣告祂大爱的人，却不能再加添甚么。不只他们不能加添他甚么，并且他们因看见「所赐他的恩典」，就承认确有福音托付了他，于是他们就向他「用右手行相交之礼」，当场证明他所传的福音，与众使徒所传的完全是和谐一致的。毫无疑问的，这福音是基督自己在祂受难复活之后，「四十天之久」向他们显现，「讲说神国的事」之时，所赐予他们的。

因为是主将各各他的信息直接启示给保罗的，所以我们并不希奇，这信息就<b>支配了</b>他的一生，并且也将这信息组织在他所有的著作里。这些信息在他里面<b>燃烧</b>，他虽然没有看见这位神而人者的受死，但他传讲祂的十字架和受难是那样强烈，并有圣灵的明证，以致他能对加拉太人宣告说：「耶稣基督钉十字架，已经活画在你们眼前」(加三1)。

当我们恭敬静听主自己借着祂的使者传讲祂的受死时，但愿圣灵再一次见证保罗所传的十字架的福音。


<h4>十字架与天然的人</h4>
「属魂的人不领会灵的事...他们对它是愚拙的」(林前二14 另译)。  
「十字架的道在那灭亡的人为愚拙」(林前一18)。  
「钉十字架的基督，在犹太人为绊脚石，在外邦人为愚拙」(林前一23)。  

虽然保罗是直接从耶稣基督的启示接受了这福音，但对这福音的接受并没有受他天然人的欺骗。像以赛亚一样，他知道十字架是「耶和华的膀臂」，必须藉圣灵纔能启示出来，因为对那些心地昏昧(弗四18)及不信背逆之子，这整个的信息都不过是显为愚拙。  

救恩从另一个人的死而来，那是违反一切公义的！人永远不承认不能救自己。十字架是完全愚拙的！

十字架的道对犹太人是一个大的绊脚石，在他们的圣经上岂不是写着：「被挂的人是在神面前受咒诅的」么？当保罗对犹太人传钉十字架的基督的时候，他一再的说：「祂在神面前是被咒诅的」或「在神面前是受凌辱的」，因为犹太人说到主耶稣时，常用旧约申命记廿一章廿三节希伯来原文的话，称祂为「被咒诅的一位」(原文有绞杀，并被大众侮辱的一位之意)。<b>犹太人没有圣灵的光照</b>，所以不懂得申命记所说的这些话，乃是指基督的十字架，祂为我们的缘故受咒诅，被挂在各各他的木头上。  

犹太人只仰望一位在地上作王的弥赛亚，他们读以赛亚的预言，只看见对那位要来者的荣耀和作王一面的预言。由于犹太人先入为主的观念，以为他们所仰望的弥赛亚，必须有权柄的表记给他们看见，所以他们一再的要求主耶稣从天上给他们显个神迹，主耶稣却回答说：「除了约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他们看。约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中；人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头」(太十二38~40)。

先知以赛亚所预言的，和先知约拿在他奇妙的经历中所描写的各各他和坟墓，恰恰是神所应许的奇特的「神迹」，为要叫人认识弥赛亚；但是以赛亚说到以色列人时，他说他们的「耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着」(太十三15)，因此论到这昏暗的百姓的预言就应验了。保罗说：「犹太人是要神迹」，但他们没有眼睛看见神所预言的神迹；「希利尼人是求智慧」，但他们不明白<b>「钉十字架的基督」是神的智慧和能力</b>。

<h4>十字架和人的智慧</h4>
「十字架的道...是神的大能」(林前一18~19)，因为经上记着：「我要灭绝智慧人的智慧」。  

保罗自己是个法利赛人，曾厉害的反对钉十字架的基督，但当他得着属天的异象之后，就深深的认识了十字架的目的。他看见十字架乃是耶和华对付伊甸园堕落的杰作。  

「女人见那颗树...能使人有智慧」(创三6)。  

<b>越过神的限制<label for="限制" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">这个限制就是“人须降服于上帝，把上帝放在第一位。”</span>，而寻求知识，乃是人堕落的原因</b>；直到今日，这个影响仍然存在，因为知识的骄傲，乃是人认识他们的创造者的障碍。十字架的拯救，乃是全智的创造者对付所有堕落的受造者知识骄傲的杰作，因为「十字架的道」乃是神的大能，以灭绝或废弃「智慧人的智慧」。十字架是神的大能，天然的人全然不能领会它，人必须将自己的智慧降服于创造者，并且接受神话语中的信息，纔能领会。圣经说：「神的愚拙总比人智慧」，有一天当人认识自己像创造者认识他们的时候，一切按肉体看来好象是「愚拙的」，都要被证明是神最高的智慧。

<h4>十字架的道</h4>

是神的能力，借着死，全智的主已经使愚拙变为世上的智慧；因为世人凭着自己的智慧，既全然不认识神，「神就乐意用愚拙的道理，拯救那些信的人」(林前一21)，这道理在人看来是愚拙的。神正在作一奇妙的工作，把人从过犯和罪的能力里拯救出来，并且照着那从死里复活的首生者之形像，再造出一新的族类。

「神的软弱」显在那位「因软弱被钉十字架」的人身上，「总比人强壮」。那位在十字架上蒙羞、软弱、并受苦的救主，有能力拯救一切信祂的人。

<h4>十字架和真智慧</h4>

「然而我们也讲智慧，但不是这世上的智慧...我们所讲的，乃是...神奥秘的智慧」(林前二6~8)。  

十字架的道对那些「得救的人」是神的大能，以废除知识的骄傲，因此能被神的智慧所教导。「这些事是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，人心也未曾想到的」。这智慧对属魂的人是一个奥秘，但对那些爱神的人，却已被圣灵启示出来了。使徒说：这智慧乃是当世上的智慧败亡的时候，使我们得荣耀的智慧。

「神的智慧在奥秘中」，而「神的奥秘就是基督；所积蓄的一切智慧知识，都在祂里面藏着」(西二2~3)，「在那蒙召的，无论是犹太人、希利尼人，钉十字架的基督总为神的能力，神的智慧」(林前一24)。

<h3>十字架的二重信息</h3>  

<h4>十字架使人的罪行得着赦免</h4>

先知以赛亚告诉我们，那位忧患子的受苦和受死，并不是为着祂自己，乃是为着那些走迷偏行己路的人；父照着自己的旨意，「以祂为赎罪祭」，并喜悦将祂压伤，使祂受痛苦。

使徒保罗也同样提到此事，他对罗马人说：神自己定意以基督耶稣作牺牲，神「设立耶稣作挽回祭，是凭着耶稣的血，借着人的信」(罗三25)，因为只有这样，祂纔能宽容人的罪，并向这个犯罪的世界显明祂的义。耶和华不顾惜自己的儿子，把祂赐给我们。经上记着说：「神在基督里，叫世人与自己和好」(林后五19)，因为父与子原为一。

保罗对歌罗西人说：「既然借着祂在十字架上所流的血，成就了和平」，是说基督作牺牲，作挽回祭的一面；当祂独自踹酒醡时，众民中无一人与祂同在(赛六十七3)，然而罪人「借着基督的肉身受死」，与神和好，这告诉我们救主和蒙恩人乃是一个；从这一方面，我们能看见末后的亚当如何作了人类的代表，为那些与祂在死里联合的人，承受了罪刑，就借着祂与神和好了。

<h4>十字架使人脱离罪的能力</h4>

使徒继续说：「借着祂肉身受死，叫你们与神和好，都成了圣洁，没有瑕疵，无可责备，把你们引到自己面前。」十字架乃是一个门，那些已经与神和好的人，可以由此门进入一个新的境界，借着基督在神面前「成了圣洁，没有瑕疵，无可责备」。那些与神和好了的人，向着他们已往的罪与基督一同死了，他们的「恶行」，就是那些使他们远离神，在心里与神为敌的「恶行」，现在也都丢在背后了。那些没有「与神和好」的，仍旧活在他们以前的生活里。所以十字架使人与神和好的信息里面，含有脱离罪的能力的意义，像脱离罪的行为一样。这在使徒彼得的宣告中，能更清楚的看到，他在彼得前书里说：「祂担着我们的罪亲身被挂在木头上，使我们既然在罪上死，就得在义上活」(彼前二24原文)。──的的确确，我们不必在罪的权势之下，再去犯罪了。

使徒在这里清楚的表明了信徒和他的救主在死上的联合，既然借着主耶稣在十字架上的赎罪，成就了和平，并借着祂被挂在木头上亲身担当了我们的罪，我们就已经在祂里面向罪和罪的能力死了；并且现在既有分于祂那从神而来的生命，就借着那住在我们里面的圣洁公义者的大能，得以在义上活着。

使徒又引以赛亚的豫言说：「因祂受的鞭伤，你们便得了医治」，这乃是说到那神圣十字架的豫言，把人从罪的捆绑和恶行里拯救出来。是神的羔羊为我们被压伤并受苦，我们这些信祂在木头上担当我们的罪，并在祂里面向罪死了，因此纔能向神活着的人，纔能得着祂生命医治的大能。

<h4>十字架的同死和同活</h4>

「和祂同钉十字架...叫我们不再作罪的奴仆」(罗六6)。保罗所说的从罪的能力得释放，明显的不是一个高深的经历，因为当他写给在罗马的信徒时，他似乎说到与基督同死乃是一个最基本的初步经历。只有在与基督同死的根基上，纔能在祂里面实际活出新生的样式来。

「且借着神儿子的死，得与神和好，既已和好，就更要因祂的生得救了」(罗五10)。当保罗再往前说到神奇妙的计划时，他说那些与神和好，并蒙所赐之义的人，要「在生命中作王」(罗五17)。从前罪怎样作他们的王，今天恩典也照样借着耶稣基督作王。

基督的死和神所赐白白的恩典，永不能再叫人去作罪的奴仆。神丰富的恩典，借着神儿子的死赐给了罪人，这是实在的，但我们与神儿子一同死了，我们这向罪死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢？基督既已受死，把罪人从罪中拯救出来，所以人断不可仍在罪中活着。罪在那里显多，恩典在那里就更多，以拯救罪人脱离罪的捆绑。

「我们的旧人和祂同钉十字架」，是各各他给予堕落罪人的信息，也是罪人从罪的捆绑之下得蒙拯救的秘诀。一切受浸归入基督的人，乃是受浸归入祂的死，借着「浸归入死」，和祂一同埋葬，原是叫人像基督从死里复活一样。人能仰望祂的十字架，并且在人的以往和现在中间有一个坟墓，像极大的深渊一样，将二者隔开，这样，就可以使我们与复活的基督一举一动同有新生的样式了。

自然，这必须他们实际并密切的联于主的死纔可以，如果仅仅在头脑里赞成，就绝不能联于祂的复活；他们必须借着圣灵，与那位钉十字架的主有实际的联合，好使他们有分于祂死的形状。

如果有了这样的联合，他们就能证实祂复活的大能，并且也知道他们已经「与基督同钉十字架」了；如此，他们就不再在罪的捆绑之下作罪的奴仆了，因为那已死的人是脱离了罪，而得称义了。罪再不能作他们的主，因为罪对他们的辖制已成过去。

再者，基督死的意义比消极的拯救还要多。他们从罪的权势之下得释放，不仅借着死，更是借着生命。基督的生命冲破死亡的坟墓，这生命要显现在他们里面；因为如果他们真向着旧人死了，他们必与基督同活，并且有分于祂现在活的生命──一个向神活着的新生命。赐给人一个丰盛的生命，作王的生命，乃是各各他的目的。基督的死，是为我们向罪而死，并且祂死「只有一次」。照样，那些看自己与基督一同向罪死了的人，要断然拒绝罪的辖制，因为「他们在基督耶稣里向神活着」。基督住在他们里面，作他们真实的生命，他们就要因他们的主耶稣基督，在生命作王。  

但是要记得，这必须是显在他们实际的生活中。他们不能一面与基督同钉，一面又降服于罪，将他们的肢体献给不义作器具；若是这样，他们就是徒受神的恩典了。如果他们愿意实际经历各各他丰满的拯救，他们必须不只欢乐着承认他们已经与那位钉十字架的主一同死了，并且他们必须将他们自己当作从死里复活的人，献给神，并在生命的新样里，将肢体献给神作义的兵器。

但这里又有问题发生，恩典既释放了我们，使我们不受束缚，岂不要带进放纵的危险吗？使徒说：「断乎不能！」岂不知因着联合于基督的死而复活，就在人的深处带来一个改变吗？那些经历基督死的能力的人，已经从心里顺服那拯救他们的模范，他们已经在生命的新样里，欢喜着成为「神的奴仆」，不再作罪的奴仆了；并且照他们自由的拣选，一天又一天的将他们的身体当作义的奴仆，在喜乐的顺服里献给神。

<h4>十字架分开的能力</h4>

在罗马六章，我们很清楚的看见十字架分开的能力。从罪和罪的捆绑里得蒙拯救的工作，在各各他已经完成了；因此使徒呼吁罗马的信徒，要在信心坚决的行动里，进入基督死的功效。他们已经与基督在十字架上死了，并且在祂的死里，已经与他们旧有的生命割绝了。「在祂死的形状上与祂联合」，他们必须看自己已经与基督同钉十字架，确确实实的向罪死了，并且在祂里面向神活着。  

有许多人以这样渴望的心呼喊说：「我虽然这样算过，但仍似无用，好象白算了一样。」  

啊！你这人哪！你的眼睛看错了地方，你的「算」乃是看你里面，不是看救主的工作；圣灵不与你的「算」同作见证，因为你的方向错了。  

要将你的眼目从一切事物上挪开，而专专注目在各各他上，主耶稣为你死了，并且作为你的代表，带你到祂的十字架上，你是否真诚的愿意离开每一件已知的罪，并且愿意在经历中活出与基督同死来呢？只要你一有此决定，你就要看见你已经与钉十字架的主一同钉在木头上了。  

靠着圣灵，信神的话，你就可以不让罪作王，因为神曾说：借着基督的死，你已经有分于那个死，罪就不再作你的主了。  

哦！神的儿女啊，在十字架下隐藏在基督里面，在生命中与祂联结，这是你一直该有的态度。因为你们顺服谁，就是谁的奴仆。当你在受试探的时候，你的衷心必须立刻退到十字架下，隐藏在那带你到十字架上去的主里面，拒绝一切能把你从祂里面拖出来的任何事。不要对任何临到你的事作无益的挣扎，

将一切事交给主──祂已将祂的生命分赐给你，你将要看见祂能天天拯救并保守。   

但现今你们既从罪得了释放，作了神的奴仆，就必须诚实的对付罪，定罪罪；并且要坚持你们的行事为人绝对的顺服你的主，真的让祂在你里面作工，并且作祂所喜悦的事。  

让每一次试炼或试探的压力逼你进到祂的面光中，在祂的光中你就看见一切，因此你就「行在光明中，像祂在光明中一样」，并且耶稣基督的宝血就洗净你一切的罪。「若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督，祂为我们的罪作了挽回祭，不单是为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪」(约壹二1~2)。――摘自宾路易师母《各各他的十字架》

<h4>十字架与律法</h4>  
「有可信的话说，我们若与基督同死，也必与祂同活」(提后二11)。  
「你们借着基督的身体，在律法上也是死了...但我们既在捆绑我们的律法上死了，现今就脱离了律法」(罗七46)。  

从死里得蒙拯救乃是使徒的信息，各各他的十字架是与神和好的地方，也是从罪的能力里得释放的地方；但那与基督同钉十字架与祂同死的人，不只向罪的捆绑死了，也向律法的捆绑死了；律法要求无助的罪人顺服律法，不能成功，反而越过越深的带人至死地。  

使徒在罗马书五至八章里思想的路线，与基督徒生活的实际经历是那么奇妙而一致。保罗说：「律法本是外添的，叫过犯显多」(罗五20)，神赐下律法的目的，只是为了显明罪的众多和罪的可恶，好使祂的恩典格外显多。当罪在可怜的罪人身上作王时，恩典也要在蒙救赎的人身上作王(罗五21)。恩典之所以能进来作王，乃是借着死，因为惟有死纔能释放罪人脱离捆绑。罪的工价乃是死，罪的代价必须清偿，死的判决必须执行；作为人类代表的基督必须死了，在祂的死里一切因罪而欠的债都清偿了，因此罪的权势在那些与主同钉的人里面也就完结了。  

同时，信徒向着那定他死罪的律法也死了。联于基督的死，人就借着基督的身体向着律法死了(罗七4)，因为人在捆绑他们的律法上死了，所以人就从律法的要求之下得着「释放」。律法不能再向已死的人要求说：「你当怎样、怎样」，因为他已经借着死到另外一个境界中去了，律法不能跟他到那个境界中；那个境界就是「在基督耶稣里」。在基督里的新地位中事奉神，乃是用欢喜顺从的新灵事奉，而不是像以往被迫作奴隶时顺服律法的字句(罗七6)。  

但在此，我们要问说：难道神所赐的「律法是罪么？」(罗七7)，使徒回答说：「断乎不是！」他进一步给我们看见，神所以赐下律法，乃是带人到一个地步，就是在自己里面到了尽头，如此纔能借着与基督同死蒙拯救。律法是我们训蒙的师傅，引我们到基督面前。  

使徒在说过了从律法的要求下得到释放之后，又活画出在人魂里痛苦的冲突，因为虽然他里面的人喜欢神的旨意，但因为还不明白保罗所说的只有借着基督的死纔能蒙拯救，所以一直活在痛苦的挣扎里。

罗马书第七章，乃是强烈的描写人在罪的辖制之下，心中渴望能成全神的旨意而有的活动。  

律法把人带到死地，因为只有「死」纔能使人停止挣扎；只有到了这个地步，人就再不能争战了，只能无望的呼喊说：「谁能救我？」保罗说：「我因律法，就向律法死了，叫我可以向神活着」(加二19)。
我们若热切的巴望摆脱我们的捆绑，就会立刻明白罗马书第七章的实际，和所描述的痛苦的经历。  

让我们从这段经文中，简略的看一看律法是怎样将人带到自己的尽头，和我们主基督耶稣是怎样来拯救我们。  

(一)律法叫我们知道何为罪：例如：若非神的律法说「不可起贪心」，我们就不知道贪心是罪。  

(二)律法显明罪的反抗性：「然而罪趁着机会...叫贪心发动；因为没有律法，罪是死的」(罗七8)。

这一幅图画在每一个人心里显得何等的真实，若有人告诉我们不可贪心，我们就发现我们自己立刻要去作所禁止我们作的事。

「你不可」这句话能激起一切堕落的天性，与神圣洁的旨意相冲突之行为，因为肉体的心思常与神为仇(罗八7)。如果没有律法的命令，罪是死的，意即罪是不起冲突的，是不起反抗的，因为若任凭人随着自己的意思行，满足自己肉体和心思的欲望，那是没有争战的；但人若面对面来到神律法跟前，并试图顺服，于是罪就起来，用尽各种方法来反抗神的命令。所以律法就显明人的自己乃是与神律法相反的。   

(三)律法带我们到死地：「我以前没有律法是活着的，但是诫命来到，罪又活了，我就死了」(罗七9)。从前没有神的诫命，我是活的。本来一切都很好，但当我面对创造者的「你要...」或「你不要...」时，在我里面立刻就有个东西起来与神的律法相争了，从前沉睡的「罪」又活了；我发现我不能顺从律法，因为我是无能为力的。罪就是借着神的律法找机会，施展罪的权能来逼我，我确实发现罪是胜过了我，罪欺骗我，明知道结果是死，但我必须屈服于罪的引诱之下。也可以说：「罪杀了我」(罗七11)；这证明在我里面除了罪的工作──死──之外，别无所有。  

神的诫命是要引我活在更美丽的生命里，但相反的，我却深深的沉在死的无助中(罗七10)，并且在极端的绝望中说：「我死了」。  

(四)律法证明罪的可恶：「律法是圣洁的，诫命也是圣洁、公义、良善的...罪因着诫命，更显出是恶极了」(罗七12~14)。借着律法的圣洁，罪「显出真是罪」(罗七13)，这是创造者何等奇妙的安排，叫
受造的人学习认识罪是甚么(受造之人没有罪的观念)，并且更叫人知道自己需要救恩。罪必须变为「恶极」，人纔真愿意除去罪，并愿意在罪的捆绑中得着拯救。  

人在愿意接受救主之前，必须先感觉到需要一位救主。在人认识救恩的阔长深高之前，须要先看见人的堕落是何等的深。借着那圣洁、公义、良善，人的努力没法成全的律法，神带人认识自己和自己的光景。  

(五)律法带人到死的无助之中：「罪叫我死...卖给罪了...在我肉体之中没有良善」(罗七13~14，18)。  
这是何等痛苦的挣扎！是何等使人的骄傲受到屈辱。人只能喊着说：「律法是属灵的，但我是属肉体的，是已经卖给罪了。」我实在是一个奴隶，因为「我所恨恶的，我倒去作」(罗七15)。  

我恨恶罪的这个事实，证明我的眼睛已经被开启，看见了神旨意的美丽和良善(罗七16)，因此我好象是两个人一样，在我心意中我羡慕作好，但我根本不能「作我所愿作的」(罗七18)。所以一面也可以说不是我作的，乃是罪作的，罪掌权并治服了我(罗七17)。我的确是一个奴隶。我现在知道了，「在我里面...没有良善」(罗七18)。我永远不能再像法利赛人说「我不像别人」。我所愿意的善，我并不作；我所恨恶的恶，「我倒去作」(罗七19)。

总结以上所说，我发现「我愿意为善的时候，便有恶与我同在」(罗七21)，我里面的人喜欢神的律法(罗七22)，但在我肢体中另外有一个律，和我心思中的律交战(罗七23)。我是在罪的残酷之下作奴隶。  

(六)蒙拯救的路：「我真是苦阿，谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢？感谢神，靠着我们的主耶稣基督」(罗七24~25)。这个可怜的人喊着求帮助，在他的呼喊里就是承认他不能拯救自己。生来的骄傲已经被打倒了。「里面的人」渴望能遵行神的律法，但不能胜过自己和罪。他虽尽力想作在神看为善的事，但他失败了，因为他还不领会十字架丰满的信息。他没有看见他已与基督同死，已经在基督里脱离了罪的辖制，和律法的要求；就在这痛苦的挣扎中，他发现了他的需要。

他可能以为这「里面的人」，借着神的恩，就能讨神的喜悦，既靠圣灵入门，借着十字架所流的血与神和好，他就可以凭着肉体来成全了。不！你这可怜的人，应当再仰望各各他。你需要在里面有另外的一个力量，就是圣灵的能力，和基督耶稣生命之灵的律，借着耶稣基督在各各他的工作，纔能使你得着自由。律法只有在人活着的时候(罗七1)，纔能显出它的管辖权。当你已经与基督同钉十字架，与祂一同死了的时候，律法再没有权利来辖制你。因着死，你已经从律法下得着释放，你已经与那位「从死里复活的」联合为一了(罗七4)。  

因着「信神的工作」(西二12)，你就得享一切神所作成的，你信么？当你依靠祂的工作时，「生命之灵的律」就要释放你；并且如果神的儿子叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。你要看见「律法有所不能行的」，因为是从外面要求你；但神差祂自己的儿子到世上来，成为罪身的形状，替你死了，就能在你里面作工，使「律法的要求」，就是你所不能顺从的，现在可以在你里面得着成全了；这乃是当你降服于神的灵，「不随从肉体，只随从圣灵」的时候成全的(罗八4)。  

哦！那些「借着耶稣基督我们的主」得蒙拯救，在他们自己里面不信自己而答应死的要求，并在那叫死人复活的神里面的人，「就不再定罪了」；因为「在基督里」他们经历了一个新而有能力的律；生命之灵内住的工作，使他们脱离罪的权势之下的个老旧的律，和死的无能了。  

「基督释放了我们，叫我们得以自由，所以当站立得稳，不要再被奴仆的轭挟制」(加五1)。当注意一步一步的行在灵里面，思念「圣灵的事」(罗八5)，并借着那位在你里面的生命之灵的能力，谨慎的「治死身体的行为」(罗八13)。你如果这样生活，你就逐日被神的灵引导，一切做奴仆的惧怕都过去了，并且你也知道你「是神的儿女，既是儿女，便是后嗣，就是神的后嗣，并与基督同作后嗣。如果我们和祂一同受苦，也必和祂一同得荣耀」(罗八16~17)。

<h3>与基督同钉十字架</h3>  

<h4>十字架乃是神拯救的大能</h4>

「因此基督死了，又活了，为要作死人并活人的主」(罗十四9)。  

「我因律法就向律法死了，叫我可以向神活着。我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着」(加二19~20)。  

保罗在这里毫不犹豫的说到他自己的经历，他向罗马人和加拉太人所传的福音，都是他亲自经历过的。并且罗马书里所说的关于与基督同死的事，再总结在加拉太书里面。  

在罗马书里，他用的字是「我们」和「我们的」，在加拉太书里则用「我」，「我向律法死了」，「我已经与基督同钉十字架」。  

从这些话里面，我们能具体看见各各他拯救的更深意义；我们越能简单的接受这信息，我们就越快的证实十字架乃是神拯救的大能。  

<h4>基督的死不只救人脱离罪，也救人脱离「我」</h4>

自从人堕落以后，「我」就成了人生命的中心，保罗说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」，律法无非是一个工具，把我带到死地──在那里承认自己毫无盼望，我也知道在我里面，就是在我肉体之中，没有良善；在那里我也停止了自己的挣扎，呼求外来的拯救；因为不能绝对顺从「律法」，就向「律法」死了，从此我就从律法之下逃出，隐藏在基督的死里，现在我已经与基督一同死了。  

我们必需记得，神的话不仅仅停在这里；当我们再被引导往前去，我们就看见十字架有更广泛的意义，来应付更深的需要。起初，我们知道基督的死，不过救我们脱离罪的捆绑，因此我们的眼睛只注视在为我们钉十字架而死的主身上，我们也听见保罗在罗马书六章六节的宣告：「我们的旧人已经与基督同钉十字架」，也承认我们是向罪死了，并且已经弃绝「恼恨、忿怒、恶毒...毁谤，并口中污秽的言语」(西三8~9)，以及一切「情欲的事」(加五19)。因此我们欢喜着证明十字架的道乃是神的大能，要救一切相信的，并且也看见「凡靠着祂──活的基督──来到神面前的人，祂都能拯救到底」(来七25)。   

<h4>但基督徒的行事仍常以自己为中心</h4>

但我们迟早要发现，我们需要更深的拯救。虽然我们承认自己向罪死了，并且在许多明显属肉体的事上也蒙了拯救，但在我们的生活中，仍有许多事是以自己为中心的，就如：在事奉上使用自己的能力，和自以为是的情形，在遭受痛苦时的自怜，图谋得到人的称赞，在受试炼时的自省和自责，与别人相处时自己过敏的感觉，在受伤害时对自己的维护，甚至有时那几乎使生命成为重担的自觉，都是表明人是以自己为中心的。  

我们在自己的努力之下，渴望能完全为着主，我们也常将自己奉献给祂，盼望能再以一新的能力为祂作工，却忘记了这乃是出于我们自己的活动，直到我们精疲力尽，发现我们的劳苦毫无属灵的果效，因此我们的眼睛被开启，看见我们一切天然的活动，对祂都是无用的。就在此时，神的灵将十字架的道，再向我们说出祂拯救的能力；这对人拯救的能力，比当初从罪的捆绑中得着释放，还要大得多。

<h4>要看见人难处的中心乃是「我」</h4>

当主耶稣呼召人来就祂十字架的时候，所说的话实在摸着了在人生命中难处的中心。祂说：「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己」(舍己就是否认自己)。在这里主没有说到人的罪，也未说到某些外面的事物，但祂知道人里面所存的是甚么，所以祂越过了任何外面的行为，而摸到了人的中心──「人的自己」。  

但愿人拒绝自己，并看自己已经与基督同钉十字架，现在乃是祂的自己──主基督──在我里面居于中心的地位，并且是祂支配一切。关于教会的纷争，保罗对哥林多人说：「你们各人说『我』...」(林前一12)，就是这个「我」引起了纷争；在圣经里，一再的看见有许多的「我」在不同的情形下出现。  

尼布甲尼撒王说：「这大巴比伦不是『我』用大能大力建为京都，要显『我』威严的荣耀么？」(但四30)。一个无知的财主说：「『我』...要对『我』的灵魂说...只管...快乐吧」(路十二18~19)。一个自傲的法利赛人说：「『我』不像别人」(路十八11)。一个自义的意念是：「『我』比你圣洁」(赛六十五5)。一个自满的态度是：「『我』是富足...一样都不缺」(启三17)。「我」是属于这一个，「我」是属于那一个，这里的「我」是指着那些「照着世人的样子行」的基督徒说的。使徒说：「因为...你们说，『我』是属保罗的，『我』是属亚波罗的，这岂不是你们和世人一样么？」(林前三3~4)。

<h4>保罗的信息重点是「不再是我」</h4>

但保罗自己怎样呢？他说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」，这是保罗的到自由的凭证。他曾用十字架的信息应付当日在基督徒中间各种的难处。当他实际应付神儿女中的问题时，诸如他们对罪的态度，以及教会中世界成分的搀杂，保罗曾一再反复的说：「我们这死了的人」，「都死了」，「因为你们已经死了」。

保罗并不是凭自己的生命活着，因为保罗虽然凭使徒的身份可以叫人尊敬，却没有向人求荣耀(帖前二6)，他仍宣告说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」。 

他写信给哥林多人说：「我算不得甚么」；对以弗所人说：「我比众圣徒最小的还小」。保罗整个人的灵乃是「不再是我」。他因基督将万事当作有损的，并且为着祂的缘故，丢弃万事看作粪土。「与基督同
钉十字架」，乃是保罗不变的宣告；他无论从那一个观点说到基都死所产生的结果，都是以各各他作为事实的基础；他所揭示的一切真理，也从来没有超过十字架的范围。使徒在加拉太书二章二十节所用的
希腊字，乃是「同钉在一起」的意思，如果我们盼望能更多认识拯救的能力，我们信心必须放在「与基督同钉十字架」的事实上，我们心中的眼睛也必须集中在钉十字架的基督身上，不要转向里面去看自己
主观的经历。  

<h4>仰望钉十字架的主是蒙拯救的路</h4>

「仰望主耶稣」，乃是属灵生命每一阶段蒙拯救的路，我们仰望十字架上的基督，正如以色列人在旷野悲惨的情况下仰望举起来的铜蛇一样──从我们因罪而死的自己里仰望各各他。当我们仰望的时候，我们就活了。我们越「仰望」祂，并看自己已经与基督同钉十字架，我们越相信已经与祂联合，并且承认自己的确向罪而死，除去每一件已知的罪，不许可罪来辖制我们，这时──当我们热切的期望得胜时──圣灵就用实在的拯救，印证在我们的信心里面。  

如果我们更多仰望各各他，我们就看见我们向「律法」也是死了，因为神不再向那些在基督里的人说「你要这样」「你要那样」了。当我们降服并顺从基督的律法的时候，神就差遣祂儿子的灵进入我们的心，呼叫「阿爸，父」，并且学习仰望祂供应我们每一个需要。

<h4>藉同钉十字架而彰显基督</h4>

我们再仰望各各他，我们就更清楚的看见「我已经与基督同钉十字架」。

当圣灵照明这信息的时候，我们就要希奇为何这久没有明白这奇妙的奥秘。我们只要将祂的十字架当作我们自己的，并且给活的基督一条路，祂就要借着我们彰显祂自己。

这样就完了吗？不！当祂死而复活、在我们里面设立宝座的时候，我们就可以在祂的光中得以见光；并且当我们将我们这复杂的人完全带到祂面光中的时候，我们将发现我们更深的需要，并且发现各各他
永远是我们获得生命的地方。

「与基督同钉十字架」。祂的十字架就是我的，我与祂同在那里，我愿意分享祂的十字架，遇见万事都说：「不再是我」。我不再单独存在，我已经浸在基督里面，祂是那位永活的，祂要借着我向前去，并且在我里面作祂看为喜悦的事。

<h3>十字架与活的基督</h3>

<h4>内住的基督乃是隐藏的奥秘</h4>

「我已经与基督同钉十字架...不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着」(加二20)。基督的内住乃是十字架的终结，也是十字架的目的。我们与基督同钉十字架，好让基督因信住在我们里面。并且这位主基督的内住，就称为一个「奥秘」──那意思就是说，这是隐藏的，必须启示出来，我们纔能明白。因此使徒早先写给加拉太人的书信中说：「神乐意将祂儿子启示在我里面」；在达与歌罗西人书中写着说：「那历代以来隐藏的奥秘...如今向祂的圣徒显明了」；这是神乐意启示在祂众儿女里面的奥秘；「并且这奥秘...有何等丰盛的荣耀，就是基督在你们里面成了荣耀的盼望」(西一27)。

<h4>保罗将所得的启示传讲给我们</h4>

这个奥秘在律法时代并未显明，直到恩典时代，保罗说，他被神立为执事，就是为要「把神的道理(或旨意)，传得全备；这道理就是历世历代所隐藏的奥秘」(西一25~26)。他心中切盼人能「丰丰足足在悟性中有充足的信心...知道神的奥秘」(西二2)，这奥秘就是他「藉启示」所知道的(弗三3)。保罗说，神特别赐恩给他，作神所拣选的器皿，向万民作见证，叫人看见「这奥秘是如何安排的」──神已将此托付给蒙了启示并将这信息传述给万民的人，并使天上执政的、掌权的(他们正注视着神在堕落的受造身上一切的作为)，可以借着教会得知神万般的智慧。

<h4>基督的内住基于与祂同钉十字架</h4>

保罗向加拉太人宣告并见证说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」，「乃是基督在我里面活着」。这给我们清楚看见，基督的奥秘的启示，能活在我们里面，乃是基于我们实际的生根于祂的死里。信徒一旦看见各各他乃是和他的实际经历发生关系的，神一切的真理就要进入美好和谐的正当地位。

当神的能力进到我们的生命中，并且当我们欢喜快乐的证明复活基督的大能借着我们来显明时，我们的光景就完全改变了。「我都得了秘诀...凡事都能作」(腓四12~13)，这是得胜的欢呼；「我活着就是基督」(腓一21)，这是更进一层的喜乐；「我只题祂藉我言语作为」(罗十五18)，这是简单的见证；「我也为此劳苦，照着祂在我里面运行的大能，尽心竭力」(西一29)，这是天天有能力的事奉。

<h4>先有同死然后纔有同活</h4>

保罗说：「已经同钉十字架...我如今...活着」，我不是一个僵尸，也不是一部机器，我是一个有感觉，有自己的心愿、盼望和喜好的人。因为我已经死了，所以纔能活的更活；因为以前被罪弄得迟钝的感官，现在既得释放，就变得更敏锐、更活泼了，不再是自觉、自察、自私、自爱的媒介，乃是复苏了过来的器官，为要使那位「活在我里面」的基督的生命和爱得彰显。

「我」和自己的性情、气质、口味，这一切造成了「我」的个格，基督就活在这个「我」里面。我知道如今不再是「我」作我生命的中心源头了，「不再是我」了，乃是神的恩典使我(使徒保罗)比众使徒格外劳苦；不是我的生命，乃是在我里面的基督的生命借着我彰显出来。

<h4>因神儿子的信而活</h4>

「我如今在肉身活着，是因信而活。」保罗的信心不是时刻努力挣扎的信心；他这「信」，「我是因神儿子的信而活，祂是爱我，为我舍己」(另译)。「我」已与基督同钉十字架，这个「我」已经过去了。神的儿子在祂十字架死的大爱里充满我全心全魂。

「为我舍己」成为生命中主要的意念，并在各各他的爱和亮光里来看万事，将自己交托在那位为我们受死有钉痕的主手中，祂会给我们带来极甜美的喜乐，并且全心充满祂的爱，在里面的信心就会自然的从我们里面涌流出来，人就不再注意到经历，也不再注意到任何地上的事物，只深深的切盼那位「死过的」能看见祂在各各他十字架上劳苦的功效，就心满意足了。

保罗说，他如今在肉身活着，乃是因神儿子的信而活，因着确信基督活在他里面，并作工在他里面，甚至他自己信心的作为，几乎也从他的感觉中出去了。复活的主占有了信徒，给他们「信心的灵」，使人时时刻刻活在信靠中，就像呼吸一样的自然、简单。

<h4>信心的道路</h4>

但在属灵生命中常有过渡的时期，信徒在这种过渡时期，应当在极大的试炼中持守神的话，承认自己已经与基督同钉十字架。应当常常更新其奉献，将自己交托神，信赖神能在他身上成就神最高的旨意，当信徒将自己投身于信实的神时，神必负责带他经过一切试炼而进入基督更宽广的生命中。

我们必须时时刻刻注意与神中间的关系，我们的信心应当永远是现在式的，这意思就是我们要抓牢神的话，我们已经与基督同死，并确实相信那位「叫死人复活、使无变为有的神」(罗四17)，用祂有创造能力的话，使在我们里面的基督的生命得到供应与维持。我们要知道耶和华说话就是行动。神创造世界时说「要有...」于是就有了；出于神口的十字架的道，也和祂创造世界时那无所不能的话一样，说有就有，命立就立。耶和华指着祂儿子的十字架说：「与祂同钉十字架」──人当回应说：「阿们，是这样」；这样十字架的信息就在一切信的人里面成了神的大能。

<h4>有可能转到律法的行为</h4>

在过渡时期，信徒亦会从信心的道路转到律法的行为去，就是回到己的努力里去。这也是加拉太信徒的危险。使徒很清楚的指明，离开各各他的异象是他们危险的原因；在使徒的话中，也使我们看见信徒一生的生活，必须拋锚在基督十字架的工作上。

「基督钉十字架，已经活画在你们眼前，愚昧的加拉太人哪，谁迷惑了你们呢？」使徒在这里很清楚的把基督钉死的事摆出来。是谁迷惑了你们，把你们的眼睛从各各他挪开了呢？使徒喊说：「你们是这样无知么？」他们曾因着异象归向了为他们受死的主，也因着相信了「真理的道」而接受了圣灵，并且也证明「十字架的道」就是神的大能，神也将圣灵丰丰满满的给了他们，这都是因为他们的「听信」(加三5)啊！

在十字架上基督救赎了他们，为他们成了咒诅，因此他们只要借着信心，就可以让圣灵一直作工在他们里面(加三13~14)；难道他们还不明白他们之能成为神的儿女，乃是因信基督吗？那些「受浸归入基督」的人，就是披戴基督么？难道他们过去所受的苦都是徒然的么？难道他们真甘愿回到律法下作囚奴，而失去神儿子的权利么？保罗痛苦地喊说：「我为你们再受生产之苦，直等到基督成形在你们里面」(加四19)。从单纯的信靠基督，再回到依靠自己和自己的工作，是何等的无知！

<h4>要固守信心的道路</h4>

今天有仇敌迷惑我们，要使神的子民转离钉十字架基督的异象。在属灵生命成长的每一阶段里，恶者都有它特别的陷阱来陷害我们，每一真理的混乱，和工作上的错误，都因未将各各他和它双重的信息作为信徒生命的中心和一切真理的中心使然，因为神其他的真理都是由此而来，一切真理都必须持守在十字架的范围之内。

一直仰望钉十字架的耶稣基督，并坚定依靠圣灵，让基督死的隔绝的能力作工在我们里面，并以祂的生命复活的能力供应我们，这就是「信心的道路」；这样，基督就能「成形在我们里面」，同时信徒也就渐渐长大，满有基督长成的身量。

<h4>在信心中坚守十字架的异象</h4>

信徒们！你既承认与基督一同钉死了，并联于复活的主，你就要谨慎，天天把心转向十字架的异象：

(一)在信心中依靠神的工作──将自己交付在十字架的死里，靠圣灵立刻治死那些不是出于神的。

(二)在信心中仰望神的信实──不要为将来的事忧虑，只负责今天的一刻，圣灵会将主耶稣的生命供应你，靠着祂的能力作你分内该作的下一件事，相信是神运行在你里面使你乐意作祂所喜悦的事。也要继续活在祂的爱里，将自己完全信托在祂的保守中。

(三)在信心中与复活的基督同行──拒绝一切向里面看或转向自己的试探。让神的话丰丰富富的存在你里面，好在你的生活态度上教导你认识祂的旨意；要全心向着祂，这样祂必藉你显明祂自己。

(四)在信心中站住──不要自高自大，要敬畏神。如果你不再单纯的依靠你的主，一切过去的经历对你都是一无用处。你若不时时从祂领受，你就一无所有。藏身在主里面，祂正为你在宝座前代求。

「也要坚守我们所承认的指望，不至动摇，因为那应许我们的是信实的」(来十23)。「我们纵然失信，祂仍是可信的，因为祂不能背乎自己」(提后二13)。

<h3>十字架与圣灵</h3>

<h4>主受难前豫先指明圣灵的工作</h4>

圣灵的任务，在主耶稣受难钉十字架的前夕，与祂门徒话别的时候，已经豫先指明了。祂说，从父来的真理的灵(约十五26)，将被子差遣到每一个蒙救赎的人那里，专为教导他们认识神的事(约十四26)，叫他们记起基督的话，为基督作见证，引导每一信徒进入真理；圣灵并不是凭自己说甚么话，乃是将受于父和子的心意交通给人(约十六13~14)，启示神永远的计划，在一切蒙救赎者的里面荣耀基督，将祂一切的丰满向他们陈明。这一切后来都应验了。  

当祂复活的那日，在耶路撒冷一间小楼上，主耶稣来站在祂门徒中间，把祂在十字架上所受的钉痕指给他们看，并吹气叫他们受圣灵(约二十19~22)。等祂升天被神右手高举之后，祂就从父领受了所应许的圣灵，将祂浇灌在地上那一群正在同心合意恒切祷告等候父的应许的人身上，这圣灵要装备他们，因为主曾说圣灵要临到他们，使他们得到工作的能力，圣灵也与他们同工，见证神儿子的死而复活。  

<h4>圣灵的恩赐基于十字架的工作</h4>

「基督既为我们成了咒诅，就赎我们脱离律法的咒诅...使我们因信得着所应许的圣灵」(加三13~14)。使徒保罗在给加拉太人的书信中的这些话，指明圣灵的恩赐乃是基于基督在各各他的十字架上的工作。从保罗的信息中，圣灵教训我们知道祂的内住和充满信徒里面，乃是根据于各各他的工作。我们蒙救赎「是凭着基督的宝血，如同无瑕疵无玷污的羔羊之血」(彼前一19)。不只如此，基督为我们成为咒诅，就是为要使我们得着圣灵。我们这些被咒诅的人与祂一同被挂在木头上，祂作了我们的代表。十字架的咒诅与圣灵的应许是连在一起的，也是圣灵作工在我们里面的一个条件。因为只有当我们承认在我们里面的一切都该受咒诅，并欢喜着接受十字架的信息，信我们已经与祂同死时，纔能使圣灵完全占有，并自由作工在我们里面。

<h4>圣灵引领人更深认识十字架</h4>

十字架引到圣灵，圣灵引到十字架。只有藉基督的死，人纔能得着圣灵；也只有借着圣灵，信徒纔能实际的联于基督的死，因此纔使我们知道复活主的内住是何等确实，并能说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」，「基督在我里面活着」。同时也只有借着基督的十字架与祂有更深的交通，纔能知道圣灵的丰满和能力。 

保罗对加拉太人所说的话也证明这点，因为他声称必须以他所传讲的各各他作为圣灵在他们里面作工的基础；并且明显的，他们虽然接受了圣灵，但他们仍须更清楚的认识十字架；因为如果他们像保罗那么深的认识与基督同死，他们就不会再落到过去凭着自己努力的情形中了。加拉太人还没有对自己完全绝望，还想依赖自己。他们虽从圣灵入了门，但不知道如何活在圣灵里面，就是在信心中活在钉十字架的神儿子的根基上，在开始的时候，就是这样的信将神的儿子带到他们里面的。今天有许多神的儿女还须要更深的认识十字架，这是和圣灵在圣徒里面的工作相关的，因为圣灵只在各各他的根基上作工。认识基督的死有多少，信徒个人享有圣灵就有多少。

<h4>十字架与圣灵相互作用</h4>

十字架引到圣灵。藉基督赎罪的工作，每一颗降服的心就可得着圣灵；降服有多少，圣灵就得着多少。  

圣灵引到十字架。这可以在主的生活行动中很清楚的看出来。在约但河受浸时天为祂开了，因为祂进入死水中，拣选与罪人同等的地位，这是各各他的豫表。借着「永远的灵」，祂能坚定的面向耶路撒冷，去喝各各他受死的苦杯。经过十字架，神的灵使祂从死里复活，在神的右边受膏胜过祂所有的同伴，今日跟随祂的脚踪而行的人也是如此。借着降服神和接受十字架──约但河所豫表的──圣灵就得着了人心的堡垒，于是就引领信徒进入十字架的真实交通，圣灵就更稳固的占有人，从里到外，中心到外围，对付生命中每一部份，显明新的需要，为着这些需要多方面的启示十字架，借着基督的死作为脱离旧生命的能力，供应基督复活的生命以达成新造。

<h4>被神的丰满充满</h4>

当信徒刚一接受圣灵时，他们会以为这就是圣灵的「充满」，但那知道只是照着当时的度量充满而已。最初的度量是小的，但若接受圣灵的引导更多的经历十字架，度量就会越过越深，于是对圣灵也就有了更丰满的认识。  

信徒从始至终借着信接受圣灵的带领，与祂合作，并且欢喜着准备接受祂一切的带领，直到主从天显现，我们这卑贱的身体变成祂荣耀的形像，虽然神救赎的人也有肉身的死，但圣灵将基督丰盛的生命赐给人，使人必不「见死」，只是睡了，「这样，就可与主永远同在，因为必死的被生命吞灭了，为此培植我们的就是神，祂又赐给我们圣灵作质」(林后五4~5)。  

「借着祂的灵，叫你们心里的力量刚强起来，使基督因你们的信，住在你们心里；并知道基督的爱...便叫神一切的丰满，充满了你们」(弗三16~18)。这段话总括了圣灵在信徒里面工作的目的。保罗为以弗所人祷告说：但愿他们借着圣灵刚强起来，好使基督因信住在他们心里。父永远的灵要得着蒙救赎的人，特为启示子的内住。祂所以使信徒刚强，乃是要基督成形在他们里面，这就是保罗在加拉太书中所说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架...基督在我里面活着。」

在此又一次提到信徒的信心，信心若无对象，信心是空的。信心完全根据神的话和在神话语后面神的特性。「信道是从听道来的」，当神的灵对人说到神的话时，神自己的灵就使接受者的心苏醒过来。如保罗对歌罗西人说的：「与祂一同复活，都因信那叫祂从死里复活神的功用」(西二12)。圣灵要供应我们一切的需要，甚至我们与祂合作的信心也是从祂而来，并且支取基督十字架的死为我们所作成的一切。

让我们再仰望各各他，我们已经与主同钉，因此我们看祂是那位永活的，求祂赐我们「信心的灵」，停止我们自己的工作，不要再努力挣扎，让我们简单的安息在祂的话中，祂就使我们像小孩子一样的信靠祂，并教导我们活在神儿子的信里，如同祂靠父活着一样。  

当基督这样启示在我们里面时，神的灵就要引领我们与众圣徒更多明白基督的爱何等长阔高深。正如这个超绝的爱显现在各各他的死上一样。更多的明白神的爱，这需要神的能力，因为只有与祂同受苦难的人，纔能明白祂的爱。单在头脑中领会别人所受的苦难，并不能交通于他的苦难，只有走同样的道路，纔能产生同样的交通。这就是为甚么主对门徒说：「我所喝的杯，你们也要喝。」  

并不仅是对基督到各各他的爱有更多的明白就算了，使徒又说「充满了你们」，充满到何种程度呢？

「达到神丰满的度量」。

这是过于我们所能了解的，也是过于人所能测度的，但祂能成就一切超过我们所求所想的。因为这是人心所未曾想到，照着在我们里面运行的大力(弗三20)，我们就能被基督的爱充满再充满，直到神的丰满充满在我们里面，如同「水势涨起成为可洑的水」(结四十七5)。哦！神的儿女啊，如果你只徒然试想认识各各他的拯救，却不依靠在里面作工的圣灵，敞开你的全人，将你自己交在祂手中，你就永不能认识这有福的生命！所以要降服于祂，活活的将你联于钉十字架的那一位，圣灵就要将这位活的主启示在你里面。你愿出任何代价顺服祂吗？你愿让祂在你的生活中有完全的主权吗？再转向各各他，相信神的话说你已经和祂一同死了，神奥秘的智慧就要借着永远的灵向你启示出来。

<h4>甚么叫圣灵的膏？</h4>

你是在事奉这位君王吗？当圣灵将基督启示在你里面时，你就知道你的主不只住在你里面，并且你还是基督身体上的一个肢体，当你被安排在这个身体上你所应在的地位时，膏油就从头流到衣襟，因此也就膏了你，使你能作神所喜悦的一切工作。如果你能舍弃自己，完全为祂的旨意而活，基督就要用圣灵藉你大大作工。但要记住：「恩赐原有分别，圣灵却是一位...功用也有分别，神却是一位，在众人里面运行一切的事...这一切都是这位圣灵所运行，随己意分给各人的」(林前十二4~11)。

神用喜乐的油膏祂的儿子，过于膏祂的同伴，因祂喜爱公义，恨恶罪恶(来一9)。基督也要使你深深的恨恶罪恶，喜爱公义；你爱主不只因为祂是爱的神，也因为祂是圣洁的。你将急切巴望神能严厉的对付你那些不像神的地方，并欢喜接受祂的管教，以使我们与祂的圣洁有分。祂的国权是正直的(来一8)，我们愈亲近祂，也就愈有分于祂的膏油。

你必须绝对给予圣灵以地位，并且要一步一步的行在圣灵里，单单依靠祂，寻求祂的旨意，得祂的喜悦；祂就要引领你，教导你如何住在祂里面，使你在祂奥秘的身体里站在合适的地位上，你就知道：「你们从主所受的恩膏，住在你们里面...自有主的恩膏在凡事上教训你们...你们要按这恩膏的教训，住在主里面」(约壹二27)。

<h3>十字架生命的一面</h3>

<h4>十字架的两方面</h4>

「一人既替众人死，众人就都死了，并且祂为众人死，是叫那些活着的人，不再为自己活，乃为他们死而复活的主活」(林后五14~15)。十字架有两方面，消极方面即从死蒙拯救；积极方面即与活的主在生命上的联合。因为基督为罪代死，和与基督向罪同死，在信的人身上是不可分的，所以死和生在信徒生命的过程中也是不可分的。

保罗对罗马人说：我们若与祂死的形状联合，也必与祂复活的形状联合。圣灵的工作使我们有分于祂的复活，也有分于祂的死，这联合像树的接枝一样。这样一个活的联合，只有在因信靠基督十字架的工作，使圣灵能以自由作工纔产生的。圣灵要用「十字架的道」(这道是活泼的，有功效的，比一切两刃的剑更快，甚至魂与灵...都能刺入剖开)，把旧生命与新生命分开，叫人活在十字架生命的一面。

<h4>复活的生命就是活的基督</h4>

但我们要记住，复活的生命与复活的基督是分不开的，我们已被栽种在祂的死里，我们是与祂同钉了十字架，也是与永活的祂有了联结，因此我们就可以在祂里面一举一动有新生的样式。我们应该一直活在复活的生命里，复活的生命不是很久以前的一个经历，乃是活的基督，祂自己就是复活，住在我们里面，当我们合乎祂工作的条件，允许祂如此作时，祂就借着我们施行祂的大能。  

再者，生命不能模仿，人也不能保证一定能把复活的生命摆出来。但生命是否在那里，并不需要证明，因为所显出的能力就是复活生命本身的见证。这生命能使人知道「来世的权能」，能使人对事物有永远的看法，并能使人脱离地上的一切吸引。

一直到「与基督同钉」的异象活画在人眼前，并且人能更多认识祂死的各方面时，圣灵纔启示十字架复活的一面；因为人若不知自己已从罪中蒙到拯救，并且他的心与生命已得到洁净，主就无法在人心里设立宝座，圣灵也不能把各各他更深的信息赐给人。

<h4>新生命的动力</h4>

「基督的爱激励我们」(林后五14)。「激励」一词的意思乃指抓住或被压服不能抗拒。保罗是说基督的爱是那样的强迫他，限制他在这条路上一直不偏左右。这爱激励、主使、勉强、催促、使他向前，这爱如同一道急流，将在这急流中的一切都携带前去。  

这就是基督的爱，祂本与神同等，不以与神同等为强夺的，反倒虚己，成为奴仆...顺服至死，且死在十字架上。这一个爱就成为与永活的主联结而有的新生命的能力，圣灵将这爱浇灌在人心里，这爱把一切自爱、自私、自利，都弃绝在一边，把人完全紧握在其能力之下。  

<h4>新生命的根基</h4>

「一人既替众人死，众人就都死了」(林后五14)。保罗说：新生命的根基乃是基督的死。没有一节圣经像这一节把十字架双层的信息说得这样清楚扼要。救主替罪人死了，所以「众人就都死了」。保罗是说：因我在各各他看见主为我死了，并且我也死在那里，我既与主同死，一切自私都除去了；那引祂去各各他的爱，今日藉圣灵也浇灌在我心里，并且这爱激励我，像激励祂，迫使祂上十字架一样。

<h4>新生命的目的</h4>

「他们不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活」(林后五15)。那与祂同死的人，现在是活在祂的生命里；他们承认祂死是「为着他们」，祂活「也是为着他们」；所以他们为此就不再为自己活，乃为祂活。他们看见他们已与祂同死，现在祂既从死里复活，这异象充满了他们，激励、催迫，使他们将身体献上，当作活祭，「是圣洁的，是神所喜悦的」，这是他们欢喜而「理所当然」所献的祭。

<h4>十字架的分别能力</h4>

「所以我们不再凭肉体认人了」(林后五16)。在十字架的亮光里，保罗现在对世人的看法，与从前他作法利赛人，行在耶路撒冷街上时，对世人的看法完全不同了。他原是「希伯来人所生的希伯来人」；但是这一切独特的社会地位都在各各他的亮光中过去了，现在他是联在复活主的生命中。所以保罗说：「我不再凭肉体认人了」──他现在活在另一个境界中，人与人间一切分界都消灭了，因为在这里「并没有犹太人，希利尼人...都在基督里成为一了。」

但在事实上与世人还是有分别的，然而这分别并不是自以为比别人更圣洁；乃是因圣灵内住的同在，将他分别出来归给神。虽然他向神活着，但仍能与人相接近，因为他看基督也是为他们死了，并且知道在神眼中并没有犹太人、希利尼人，只有一位主，就是「万有的主」，并且「祂也要赏赐一切求告祂的人」。他被十字架分别出来，乃是从地的独尊骄傲中分别出来，并为主的缘故服事众人，作了众人的仆人。

借着圣灵的能力，十字架也使保罗不再凭肉体认识基督了，以前对基督的认识只是外面的，如同主的门徒在各各他以前对基督的认识一样，似知不知，因为那时祂实在是藏在祂肉身的幔子里。今日很可能也有许多人，只认识历史上的那位基督，祂的降生、受死、复活、升天，这一切都不过只是外面客观的事实和知识，但不能经历其生命中真实的能力。与基督同死却改变了一切，因为在十字架生命的一面，圣灵要启示复活的主，并且在「圣灵里」就能认识祂是永活的那一位。

<h4>在基督里的新生命</h4>

「因此若有人在基督里，就是一个新创造，旧事已过，都变成新的了」(林后五17原文)。若有人在基督里──受浸归入祂的死──借着十字架的门进入基督的境界，基督就作他的一切，正如基督成为他生命的新源头一样。与活的基督联在一起，旧的事就都成为过去，因为在基督里的乃是一个新造，不是将旧的改良或教育而成的。

在十字架生命的一面，信徒与活的基督联合，就是「穿上新人」(西三10)。借着耶稣之灵逐日的供应(腓一19)，「这新人渐渐在知识上增长，正如造他主的形像」(西三10)，在这里基督是一切，又在一切之内。天然的孩子如何长成他父亲的形像，照样由救赎而得的新生命，也要渐渐长成造他主的形像。

如果我们对与基督同死能继续不断的有更深的认识，并让一切的旧事都成为过去，将地位让给新人，使他能继续增长，这新人乃是「照神的形像造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁」(弗四24)。

<h4>为着别人的新事奉</h4>

「一切都是出于神...并且将这和好的道托付了我们，所以我们作基督的大使」(林后五18~20)。在基督里的新人，清楚知道他已被分别出来归于神了，并且他也不在属地的立场上与人相交往了，乃是在那位替众人死者的名里，尽神所托「劝人与神和好的职分」。神将「和好的道」──即十字架的信息──交托祂的大使。这道是写在他们心里，组织在他们里面的，正像以西结在对以色列传说神的话以前吞吃了那书卷一样，所以基督的大使也必须有这样的准备，好能真实的替基督说话并作神的代表。借着他们显明「十字架的道」就是神的大能，因为他们乃是「与神同工的」，祂要借着他们求祂所替死的人，不要辜负了神的恩典，当在这救恩的日子宝贵祂的呼召。

<h4>外面生活的表现</h4>

「凡事不叫人有妨碍...在各样事上表明自己」(林后六3~4)。从十字架的根基开始，我们看见从各各他涌出的生命的特性，因着活在祂的死与复活的联结上，这生命就渐渐增长。  

「不再为自己活」是其坚定的意愿，「乃为替他们死而复活的主活」是其不变的目的，「我看基督是为万人死的」是对别人行动的原则，「旧事已过」是对以往的态度，「祂把和好的职分托付我」是对别人
的责任，「我必须与祂同工」是天天受约束并坚守的态度。  

<h4>保罗活出的榜样</h4>

「不再为自己活」，这可以在使徒对他一生的简单叙述里活活的表示出来(林后六4~10)。外面的环境虽然是患难、穷乏、困苦、鞭打、监禁、骚扰、勤劳、儆醒、禁食，但这新生命却能在忍耐、纯洁、认识神、坚忍、恩慈里显明出来，一个真正活「在圣灵里」和无伪的爱里的生命，确能显出神的大能来。有仁义的兵器在左右防护，保罗就能生活在荣耀或羞辱，恶名或美名里，他被人认为是诱惑人的，却是诚实的；似乎是不为人所知，却是人所共知的；似乎要死，却是活着的；这乃是靠着在他里面的生命天天更新的能力而有的。

虽遭受极大的痛苦，却不至死亡，因为仇敌摸不到他的生命；世上一切的忧愁，似乎都因他认识那一位而变为欢乐；虽然在各方面都是贫穷的，却能使许多人得到永远的财宝成为富有；自己似乎是一无所有，但在基督里却是样样都有的；因为一切的智慧知识都在祂里面藏着。

哦！神的儿女，在这一个榜样的里面是没有一点地位保留给自己的，如果你真的联于主，并且安于祂的死，照着你的度量来更深认识这涌自各各他的生命，就能行事为人和主一样，将荣耀称颂归给神。

<h3>就世界而论，我已经钉在十字架上</h3>

当使徒从各各他复活的一面来看世界时，他看到十字架是怎样作了他与世界中间分开的能力。在各各他的光中，他呼喊说：「但我断不以别的夸口，只夸我们主耶稣基督的十字架；因这十字架，就我而论，世界已经钉在十字架上；就世界而论，我已经钉在十字架上」(加六14)。这是因为有人正在逃避十字架的逼迫。当时十字架在某一特殊形式下，乃是一个「绊跌」；但十字架却叫人(无论犹太人或外邦人)得着救恩与释放，从受割礼的仪式中被解救出来。这十字架是犹太教的结束，结束了犹太教的独尊和肉体的条例。神是个灵，祂喜欢人在灵和真实里对祂的敬拜，也就是在心中属灵的圣殿里向祂献上赞美的祭(约四23~24)。

传这样的福音，只讨基督的喜悦，并不讨人的喜悦。保罗呼喊说：我不只向世界死了，甚至对宗教的世界而言，我也已「与基督同钉十字架」；若我所传的十字架正如主所启示给我的，我就看见祂的十字架就是我受苦的工具，正如十字架是祂受苦的工具一样。我虽然将万事当作有损的，但神禁止我以此为夸口，我若有可夸的，就是夸祂为我受苦。惟愿在祂各各他的光中，十字架令人讨厌的地方成为最高的夸耀。我断不以别的夸口，只夸基督的十字架。就我而论，世界已钉在十字架上；就世界而论，我已钉在十字架上；所以我们乃是彼此向着对方死了。在基督里一切旧事都已过去了，受割礼不受割礼都无关紧要，一切外面的分别都消除了，这个属灵的新造是一切又在一切之内。

当你在神的光中看十字架时，你就看见各各他乃是神的智慧和能力。以前我们惧怕十字架的要求，因为十字架对我们只是除去和死亡，但当信徒与主越有亲密的交通时，祂的死就被属天的亮光所照亮，叫我们看见基督受死更深的意义，和与之俱来的荣耀。

十字架也是保罗与这「恶世」每一方面中间的深渊。与基督同钉，不只救他脱离罪的暴虐，并且也脱离了世界和世界的一切。主基督的死，「为要救我们脱离这罪恶的世代」(加一4)。祂死在十字架上「救了我们脱离黑暗的权势」(西一13)，把我们迁到「祂爱子的国里」。所以我们向世界死，不只向属世的事物和道路死，乃是向世界本身死，并且与主同钉，乃是巴望世界对我们的看法，正像祂被挂在木头上时世界对祂的看法一样，我们和祂同钉在那里，我们也必须从十字架来看世界，并且以钉十字架的耶稣的灵为那些钉我们在十字架的人祈求。

让我们再一次来到各各他，我们就能在十字架的亮光中，看世界是怎样整装以待的来抵挡神的圣者，并且知道我们这些与基督联合的人所期望的是甚么，那就是如果我们与祂一同受苦，就必与祂一同得荣耀。

「兵丁...就拿祂的衣服...拈阄」(约十九23~24)。从十字架下打赌的四个兵丁身上，我们看见天然的人性对别人的痛苦是何等的无情，只要能力所及，就尽力占便宜。今天有许多人就是这样的迫害基督，他们除了物质的享受之外，一无所想。

「祭司长...说...现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信祂」(太廿七41~42)。不只现今的世界弃绝主的十字架，就是宗教的世界也弃绝了它；他们不愿跟随一位钉十字架的主，他们喜爱高位首座，喜爱人在街市上问他们安，称他们为拉比(太廿三6~7)，他们能说不能作，喜欢凡事作在人面前。虽然在这廿世纪到处都挂着钉十字架主的名，但宗教的世界都不喜欢十字架。喜爱权势和人的称赞，是与十字架的灵相反对的。

「从那里经过的人辱骂祂，摇头说：咳！你这拆毁圣殿，三日又建造起来的，可以救自己从十字架上下来吧」(可十五29)！那班乌合之众经过十字架时也加入了呼喊，他们辱骂那位钉在十字架上的，并且以出于祂口的话嘲笑祂(太廿七39~40)。

那日兵丁、强盗、官长、祭司长、文士、群众都忘记了他们中间的界限，在各各他连在一起了。十字架对于他们，似乎证明祂并不是神的儿子。他们要有超然的神迹纔能相信，祂只要能从十字架上下来，就可以在他们面前证明祂是弥赛亚。今天这个邪恶的世界上的形形色色的人物，也都在各各他联合起来，都与那个特殊的邪恶权势联合起来抵挡十字架；只有站在十字架这边的少数人，传十字架，表明他们「已经向世界钉死了」。十字架是将他们钉死的刑具，像主一样。十字架再显出它分开的能力。在各各他没有中立地带。

今天，我们是否能说「十字架是我的夸耀」呢？我们是否愿背起十字架并被世界弃绝呢？远离这个世俗的世界和它一切的目的、利益，和自谋、自荣、自爱的灵，以及宗教的世界，和凡是企图使我们与主隔离的所有属世的事物呢？「耶稣...在城门外受苦。这样，我们也当出到营外就了祂去，忍受祂所受的凌辱」(来十三12~13)。

<h4>在基督徒生活中属世的事物</h4>

「你们若是与基督同死，脱离了世上的小学，为甚么仍像在世俗中活着」(西二20)？歌罗西的信徒在他们基督徒的经历中，正落到注重哲学和人的遗传；保罗说这是凭世上的小学，而不是凭基督。保罗未对歌罗西人讲甚么大道理，只传讲各各他的信息，将他们带至各各他说：「你们若是与基督同死」了，为甚么仍像在世俗中活着呢？为甚么你们又要回到只注意外面事物的小学中去呢？受别人管辖，「拘泥在所见过的，随着自己的欲心，无故自高自大」(西二18)，而不持定基督，祂乃是教会全体之首，是祂肢体的生命，所以祂的身体是靠着祂从里面渐渐增长，「就因神大得长进」(西二19)。

你若是与主一同死了，祂就必作了你的生命，为甚么又回到那不可摸不可尝的规条中去呢？这一切外面的事物在正用的时候就都败坏了。「其实，食物不能叫神看中我们，因为我们不吃也无损，吃也无益」(林前八8)。保罗说：「这些规条徒使人有智慧之名，用私意崇拜，自表谦虚，苦待己身，其实在克制肉体的情欲上是毫无功效」(西二23)。

歌罗西人既与主同死，脱离了世上的小学──人的遗传──他们存着虚妄的心思，幻想能克制自己，但这并非跟随基督。真割礼──心里的割礼──乃是凭着基督，与祂一同埋葬，也与祂一同复活，进入新生命；所以他们行事为人，不应再像在世俗中活着的人了。若与主同钉，就必与祂一同复活，这样的信心，就能带进基督复活的超越能力来，他们就不再注意如何与外面一切的事隔绝，并问何事可做、何事不可做了。他们就要只思念上面的事，并将他们的心思放在属天的丰满上(西三1~3)。这丰满在基督里都是他们的。使徒说：「你们已经死了，你们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。」他们已经从旧生命中出来，进入基督的生命里，并且借着这从神而来的生命，就可以「治死」他们的肢体，学习认识从肉体的情欲中蒙拯救的秘诀。

今天在我们中间，也有歌罗西人这样的危险，属世的基督徒常藉圣洁、奉献之名，很容易陷入这些网罗里，他们虽然跟随了基督很久，但却非常容易受人的教训所影响，特别是那些他们所最崇敬的人。

基督的十字架是一切的拯救，愿我们的心都能同意与祂同钉，如此我们就发现世界已被钉在十字架上，失去了它的吸力，就是宗教仪式也不能影响我们活在主面前。一切不出于父而出于世界的事物，就如肉体的情欲，眼目的情欲，今生的骄傲，对我们而言都已钉死了，我们要胜过世界，因为那在我们里面的，比那在世界上的更大(约壹二16；四8)。

<h4>十字架是合一的根基</h4>

「借着基督的血已经得亲近了...祂是我们的和平...使两下归一，藉十字架废掉仇恨」(弗二13~16)。如果各各他的十字架是神的儿女与世界分开的能力，同样也是所有藉宝血以亲近神的人中间合一的能力。在十字架生命的一面，所有蒙它血所赎回的神的儿女，很清楚的认识他们在基督里已经成为一了。各各他是罪人与神和好的根基，更是人与人合一的根基，也是基督徒合一的根基。何等悲痛的事，就是在许多与主同死的信徒中，仍在世界的小学中结党纷争。按说，基督借着死已经拯救了我们，然而我们却否认了基督死的功效。

保罗一生的题目就是十字架乃进入新生命的通路，他特别对歌罗西人说，既与主一同死了，就应活在新生命中，在那里一切属地的结党纷争都不存在了，「不拘是犹太人、希利尼人、受割礼的、非受割礼的、化外人、西古提人、为奴的、自主的，在基督里都成为一了，因基督是一切，又在一切之内」(西三11)。他认为：「基督以自己的身体，废掉冤仇，就是那记在律法上的规条」(弗二15)。祂自己成了和平，使犹太人和外邦人，在自己里面造成一个新人了。既与神和好，就藉十字架消灭了他们之间的仇恨。

哦！何等荣耀的各各他信息，从这里教会产生了，一切祝福降下了。感谢主，使徒的信息使我们外邦人在今日像在使徒那时一样，因十字架得以同为后嗣，同为一体，同蒙应许。复活的主带着祂的钉痕，祂死为使万民成为一个新人，现在祂又亲自「来传和平的福音」(弗二13)，但愿祂今天能再带着这大喜的信息临到我们，将祂的手、祂的肋旁指示我们，并向我们说：「愿你们平安，」使祂教会中每个肢体，因着十字架摒除一切宗派，合而为一。

<h3>十字架与黑暗的权势</h3>

<h4>基督在十字架上胜过了仇敌</h4>

「神的儿子显现出来，为要除灭魔鬼的作为」(约壹三8)。以赛亚曾特别说到十字架的得胜，他说忧患子「与强盛者均分掳物」；而使徒保罗也对歌罗西人说：「藉祂的死，将一切执政的、掌权的掳来，显明给众人看，就仗着十字架夸胜」(西二15)。关于这些执政的、掌权的，在以弗所六章里说是「管辖这幽暗世界的」邪灵，或「属灵气的恶魔」，是在空中的；在这一境界有黑暗的势力存在，它们是属灵的恶魔，是凭肉体血气照世人样子行的人所不认识的。

<h4>仇敌尽力抵挡十字架的信息</h4>

仇敌尽力使神的儿女不认识灵界的事，免得他们的眼睛得开，明白了他们「不是与属血气的争战，乃是与...属灵的恶魔争战」(弗六12)。仇敌也在各方面抵挡十字架的信息，阻止信徒认识各各他的得胜乃是胜过黑暗君王的；诡诈的仇敌若不是想说服神的儿女以为它并不存在，否则就是特别夸大它的能力，将人紧捆在罪里，欺骗说在坟墓的那边根本就没有拯救。

在事奉神的事上，基督徒常用属肉体的兵器，所以不能有效的抵挡仇敌。有的人又活在热心的计划里，尽其所能为主救人，但在背后和四周的恶魔和那看不见但却是实际存在的邪灵，正在嗤笑各种属肉体的兵器；对此它是一无所惧的，魔鬼所怕的乃是那些真正钉十字架的神的儿女，借着圣灵显出的基督完成的工作的能力。因此我们不要希奇黑暗的君王那么恨恶十字架；它不惜用全力使十字架信息落空，把各各他丰满的意义向神儿女遮蔽，并叫人疑惑各各他的能力。

<h4>撒但曾企图使主转离十字架</h4>

当人子在地上时，撒但曾试探过祂，想叫祂转离十字架。在旷野，它用万国荣华叫主不去十字架，只要主向它下拜，但主回答说：「当拜主你的神」，祂弃绝那试探人的，转向羞辱的十字架。后来那试探人的又藉彼得的口说：「主啊！可怜你自己」，想要阻止主去受死，但主说：「撒但退我后面去罢，你是绊我脚的，因为你不体贴神的意思，只体贴人的意思」(太十六23)。

撒但一再想阻止神子去各各他，它有时藉众人身上的鬼反对主，因为它知道神的圣者能终止它在人身上的能力。到末了，仇敌要把主转离十字架的诡计失败了，就改用苦毒的煽动。当祂受死的时刻将到时，指明祂清楚知道祂受死的目的，祂不只为众人赎罪，并且祂也胜过地狱的权势。「这世界的王要被赶出去，我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我」(约十二31~32)，这是主对门徒说的话，预先告诉我们，一切神的能力都集中在各各他，吸引人归祂自己，救人脱离罪和魔鬼的掌权。

<h4>得胜的时刻</h4>

「既将一切执政的、掌权的掳来，明显给众人看，就藉十字架夸胜」(西二15)。在世人眼前，在这个时刻，神的基督确是蒙羞失败以至于死了；但就在这个时候，在神及天使天军面前，乃是一切执政的、掌权的蒙羞受辱，并被它们所钉死的基督胜过了。

保罗说这些执政的、掌权的被明显给众人看，如同得胜者的掳物或战利品一样。这位得胜者乃是在得胜中在天使天军面前率领他们，林后二章十四节说：「常帅领我们在基督里夸胜」，基督带领那些被祂的爱所征服，并欢然作了祂死的战利品的人夸胜。但当日围绕着十字架的侮慢的群众，很少知道在看不见的境界里所有的得胜行列，恶魔已经被那得胜者公开的羞辱了。

<h4>圣灵的见证</h4>

「保惠师...要叫世人...为审判自己责备自己...为审判，是因这世界的王已经受了审判」(约十六11)。在十字架受难的前夕，主对门徒说，真理的灵要来住在他们里面，并见证祂，荣耀祂。在十字架之前，主曾说：「这世界的王要被赶出去」，祂死而复活之后，圣灵来见证说：「这世界的王已经受了审判」。

神的儿子在各各他的十字架上，已经完全胜过了地狱的权势，并且赐下圣灵为叫世人相信祂的得胜，并见证神儿子的工作。神的儿女很少人认识借着十字架的死，他们的仇敌已经被制服了，也很少认识如何来对付那恶者的诡计，更少人能有分于十字架的得胜而与恶者争战。

<h4>羔羊的血</h4>

「弟兄们胜过它，是因为羔羊的血，和自己见证的道，他们虽至于死，也不爱惜性命」(启十二11)。启示录这一章里，我们看见了在那看不见的世界里的争战是怎样进行的。生命的主与黑暗的君王在十字架上有一次最后的争战，黑暗的君王已经不再能控制那些相信钉十字架的主的人了，它已经从它的地位上被驱逐出去了，于是天上要有争战，大龙要被摔到地上来，并扔入火湖里。虽然它已在十字架上被征服，但在荣耀的得胜和撒但被扔在火湖里之间，尚有一段时间，在这段时间内，世人可藉此机会蒙恩，信徒可应用各各他的得胜，来胜过已被征服的仇敌，那有分于得胜主的宝座的得胜者，要赢得冠冕。

天上这个最后的争战，向我们启示得胜的三重奥秘，和每一个得胜者胜过仇敌的方法：他们得胜，「是因羔羊的血」，这叫我们回到各各他和基督的受苦。这些得胜者显然是受十字架得胜的圣灵的教导，羔羊的血──死──是对付仇敌的兵器。同时还有，「见证的道」──不怕承认基督，并「虽至于死，也不爱惜性命」。他们不只善用十字架的能力对付仇敌，并且他们领受了主受死的灵，结果就活出钉十字架的生命来，借着主的灵，胜过黑暗的君王。十字架是神所有儿女得胜之路，与主的死联合，有分于于祂复活的生命，并与祂同坐在诸天界里，「远超过」一切地狱中执政的、掌权的。

<h4>钉十字架</h4>

「基督既在肉身受苦，你们也当将这样的心志作为兵器」(彼前四1)。仇敌已被征服了，为了应付争战，宝血的能力也为我们准备了，但如果我们不能更深认识钉十字架的主里面的灵，在那攻击我们的邪恶的势力面前，就仍然不能有能力。

主在这恶世只拣选受苦的道路；祂虽为万有的主，却取了奴仆的形像；祂虽是大能的，却宁愿软弱，凡事与人一样；祂虽是与神同等，却成为人，自甘卑微；祂拣选并遵行父的旨意，直到进入十字架的痛苦和羞辱里。祂一步一步更低的降卑自己，十字架对祂不是一个道理，乃是祂肉身受苦的实际经历。

神的儿女要以这样的心志武装自己，让这心志在你里面如同在基督里面一样。如果你拣选这个，那么在十字架上祂受死的灵就要分赐与你，你就能「与罪断绝」(彼后四1)，不再活在天然人的喜好里，乃要照着神的旨意而活。你如果这样活着，别人自然要说你们是一班奇特的人，并毁谤你们；但你们若为基督受苦，你们要喜乐，因为神那荣耀的灵常住在你们里面；你们若为神受苦，神必因你们得荣耀(彼前四14)。

<h4>神的全副军装</h4>

「要靠着主，依赖祂的大能大力，作刚强的人。穿戴神全副军装，就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计...并且胜过了一切，还能站立得住。」(弗六10~11，13)。保罗这话表明信徒自己的能力必须先带到尽头，因为那些与主同死，同复活，同坐在诸天上的人，应当在主里借着祂的大能大力刚强起来，站在他们的立场上，抵挡「魔鬼的诡计」，将仇敌从各各他和主面前驱逐出去。「我们并不是与属血气的争战」(弗六12)。属灵的仇敌乃是用属灵的方法攻击属灵的人，信徒是与看不见的仇敌争战；信徒若凭自己「争战」，是无益的，只有靠圣灵「站住」，不惜任何代价，降服在基督面前，不然就必会落在魔鬼的诡计里。  

基督已在十字架上胜过了仇敌，你们这些联于祂的人，也应像祂一样胜过仇敌，这样纔能有分于祂的宝座。当信徒认识了各各他的得胜，并要进入基督里的时候，魔鬼要用一切的诡计来攻击你；企图将你从主那里拖开，因此战士保罗呼喊说：「所以要拿起神所赐的全付军装。」信徒必须穿上全副军装，纔能在磨难的日站稳，并且可胜过魔鬼一切诡计。「全副军装」就是基督自己，住在祂里面就可胜过魔鬼全军。  

当用真理当带子束腰，不可有一件事在生活中违背真理；要用公义作护心镜遮胸，绝不可不义，因祂喜爱公义，恨恶罪恶；要传和平的福音，听从圣灵，不留机会给魔鬼；用信心作藤牌，灭尽恶者的火箭；戴上救恩的头盔，免得中了诡计，像夏娃一样；将一切思想夺回，归顺基督；用圣灵的剑──神的话──防卫仇敌的攻击。

与主不断的交通，靠着圣灵随时多方祷告祈求，你就能以起来抵挡仇敌，靠着爱我们的主越发可以夸胜。要认识这战争的凶猛，一人会影响全军，所以要为众圣徒祈求，特别是在战争前线如保罗这样的人。只有这样的战士，纔能在为主争战的日子站住，要被差遣到前线去，穿戴光明的军装，在战争中赢得十字架的得胜。

<h3>十字架与十字架的连续性</h3>

<h4>模成基督的死</h4>

「使我认识基督，晓得祂复活的大能，并且晓得和祂一同受苦，效法祂的死」(腓三10)。在全本圣经里没有一处论到在基督徒的生活中十字架的连续性，比这里说得更清楚的了。在加拉太书中，保罗曾非常快乐的呼喊说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」。然而在这里，他又说到模成基督的死，乃是更多认识基督复活大能功效的条件。

保罗是非常清楚认识圣灵的丰满的；基督曾亲自将十字架的信息启示他，托付他，他也曾明白的传扬了借着十字架拯救人脱离罪的捆绑；虽然他传这信息背后，有圣灵大能的印证，在自己的生活中，也有着切身的经历，但我们看见使徒仍在寻求能更多认识「基督的死」。更深一层的经历从保罗的话里显明出来，就是属灵生命更丰满的成熟，乃是在于更深的交通于基督的苦难，因为复活生命的最高峰，乃是归回到十字架，所以使徒一直朝向神在基督耶稣里从上面召他来得的奖赏而去，更热切的渴慕能模成主的死，因为他知道：「如果和祂一同受苦，也必和祂一同得荣耀」(罗八17)。让我们再从使徒保罗的书信中，看在他一生的实际经历里面「模成主的死」究竟是甚么意义。

<h4>死的判决</h4>

「被压太重...力不能胜，甚至连活命的指望都没有了，自己也断定是必死的，叫我们不靠自己，只靠叫死人复活的神」(林后一8~9)。这段经文使我们清楚的看见，不论我们是多么深切的认识与基督同死，并晓得祂的复活大能，却一次过一次的被带到一个地步，使我们深深的感到自己实在是毫无力量，像保罗所说：「甚至连活命的指望都绝了」，神藉此告诉我们这是因为死在我们里面，使我们对自己完全绝望，并投靠在祂里面，因为只有祂是叫死人复活的神。这就是那些遭遇患难的人何以能欢乐着呼喊说：「我已经与基督同钉十字架」的缘故。我们需要好好的学习来证明那叫死人复活神的大能，因着我们的智力被带到尽头，因着环境上一处又一处超过我们力量所能胜的艰难，使我们除了依靠神之外别无帮助。因此当使徒保罗认识神之后，他能说信靠自己无疑的就是我们一生中最大的危险；所以若要显明基督复活的大能，就必须将我们带到尽头。

<h4>因软弱被钉十字架</h4>

「祂因软弱被钉在十字架上...我们也是这样同祂软弱」(林后十三4)。在这话中，我们能看见「模成祂的死」的另一方面。当基督甘心像羊被牵到宰杀之地，又在人手下像一个软弱无能的牺牲时，那是说出祂人性的软弱，也是保罗自己软弱的一幅图画。

他看见神的儿子「因软弱被钉在十字架上」，他喊着说：「我们也是这样同祂软弱」；但当他想到基督是怎样「藉父的荣耀复活」，并怎样「因神的能力而活」时，他就欢乐的知道，就是在他软弱的时候，也可以借着神的大能，有分于基督的生命，因此他又说：「我因神向你们所显的大能，也必与祂同活」。

保罗说：我自己是软弱的，我也因着我的软弱被钉十字架，乃是要模成我主的死。我实在是软弱的，但借着我所显出来的祂并不是软弱的，祂在你们里面乃是有大能的。  

在十字架复活的一面，「模成祂的死」，并不是使我们感觉更刚强，乃是在我们自己里面感到更软弱。

软弱纔真正是十字架的钉死，因为这是与我们天然渴慕自己能作这个能作那个相反的。虽然一直活在感觉软弱的光景里，但却能借着信心靠神的能力行事为人，借着信心让「基督在我们里面说话」，借着信心靠神的能力「与祂同活」(不是对自己而言，乃是对别人而言)，纔是真正信心的生活。在信徒里面「又软弱，又惧怕，又甚战兢」，但同时在别人的心和生命中却是「圣灵大能的明证」，这是神借着那些与祂同钉十字架的人彰显基督生命的方法。

<h4>耶稣的死</h4>

「身上常带着耶稣的死，使耶稣的生也显明在我们身上」(林后四10)。这段经文最好放在罗马书第六章那里，因为这一段乃是那一段的后果。林后四章十节乃是基督在各各他客观方面工作而有的主观方面的结果，如果信徒没有这主观方面「带着耶稣的死」，就不能在我们周围的世界中，将耶稣的生命以大能彰显出来。

许多人知道与基督同死的真理，也看见了他们自己已经与基督同钉十字架，并且在他们新鲜的异象和信心的喜乐里，为那位复活的主竭力作见证。但慢慢的这生命不再有能力了，他们的见证也变成了空洞的，如同响的钹一样，而他们自己常是感觉不到。这是甚么缘故？这是因为他们只活在十字架拯救的过去经历里，并没有看见在对各各他有了客观的认识之后，就是在认识了与基督同死之后，仍要一直以死作为生命增长的根基，因为「身上常带着耶稣的死」，纔能一直彰显祂的生命。从这段经节的上下文，我们能看见所谓「带着耶稣的死」，在神儿女实际的经历中，是甚么意义。

基督在十字架上忍受从各方面来的迫害，但却未被困住，当父向祂掩面不顾，祂能困惑着呼喊「为甚么离弃我」，但却没有失望；祂虽被打倒至于死地，但却没有被毁灭，因祂靠神的大能活着。保罗也是这样受敌，作难，受逼迫，被打倒；但基督启示给他的十字架的原则却永远是真实的，他看见在他所遭遇的一切苦楚里，只是要他「带着耶稣的死」，好使耶稣的生能显明在他必死的身上；他一直落在力不能胜的光景里，好使他完全靠神的能力而活。

全智的主就是这样对待祂的儿女们，使他们真正的依靠祂，成为虚空的器皿归祂使用。同时神也榨尽他们一切属己的力量，好使他们单单向神支取能力。主知道怎样把他们带进只有祂的生命纔能胜过的各种环境；带他们到四面受敌的环境，好让神无限的资源显出来；带他们到困惑作难的环境，但过后却能看见是如何奇妙真实的带领了他们；带他们到风暴漫船来的环境，却未被神所丢弃；带他们到被人打倒，似乎一切事物都在反对他们的环境，然而却看见主耶稣的生命──以其神圣坚忍的大能进到祂恩典的荣耀里──显明在他们身上。

<h4>常被交于死地</h4>

「因为我们...常为耶稣被交于死地，使耶稣的生也显明在我们这必死的身上」(林后四11)。这节圣经清楚的告诉我们，在最初「常带着耶稣的死」乃是为着我们自己，使我们一直留在自己毫无能力的立场上，好证明那莫大的能力，是出于神，不是出于我们。信徒既将「自己」带到了尽头，而让主耶稣的生命显在这尘土所造的身体上，就渐渐更进一步的「为耶稣的缘故被交于死地」。软弱再软弱，试炼再试炼，作难再作难，争战再争战；一切都为着祂，祂已死过，祂必看见祂劳苦的功效，就心满意足。

我们这班神的儿女，是否愿意跟随主到这种地步？舍弃就是得着丰富的律；与那位永活者联结，祂就要引领我们，直到我们能更深的与祂这位曾死过的主有交通，并且为着祂的教会，补满基督患难的缺欠。

<h4>死为使别人得生而发动</h4>

「死是在我们身上发动，生却在你们里面发动」(林后四12)。这乃是为耶稣的缘故交于死地的结果。死在我们里面发动，乃是为着使别人得着生命的果效。要将生命分给别人，没有别的途径，只有倒空自己，使自己软弱；这是真实的牺牲自己，真实的没有自私；这是十字架的灵，也是主耶稣的生命在我们这必死的身体上真实的彰显；因为这正是使基督去各各他的爱，祂在各各他所得到的，只是那可怖悲惨和羞辱的死，好使我们借着祂得到从神而来的生命。牺牲自己是拯救灵魂惟一的途径，如果我们要作祂生命的江河供应别人，也就必须将我们的生命舍弃。

如果我们在深处认识了十字架真实内在的能力，别人心的深处也就被感动了，生命的能力就要作工在他们里面，因为死在我们里面作工多深，生命在基督为他们死的人身上活过来就有多深。

每一个蒙救赎的人都知道这是结果子的生命。这也就是保罗所说的「为父的」生命，他说：「我在基督耶稣里用福音生了你们」；「作师傅的虽有一万」，但「为父的却是不多」。很少人愿意在那位为我们
被钉十字架的主里一同有分，以认识而效法祂的死，为人受生产之苦。罗马书第八章当说到在基督生命之灵里丰满荣耀的自由后，在启示出我们可以欢乐的进到父面前之后，在见证圣灵内住，及在与基督同为后嗣之后，却以模成祂的死的惊人描述作为这一切的结束：「我们为你的缘故，终日被杀，人看我们如将宰的羊。然而靠着我们的主，在这一切事上，已经得胜有余了」(罗八36)。这就是使徒得胜的见证。基督曾如同羔羊一样被人牵到宰杀之地，因为我们已经拣选了祂的十字架，所以也当与祂一同被杀，别人岂不也要同样的看我们如同将宰的羊吗？

哦！神的儿女们，我们可以传十字架，甚至为十字架争战，但除非我们准备好为十字架而活，那就是照保罗的话说，要准备「终日被杀」；这样死在我们身上发动，生就要在别人身上发动。在我们身上是：虚空、软弱、痛苦、逼迫、作难；但在你们里面却是生命。

<h3>十字架的呼召</h3>

<h4>跟从主必须走十字架的道路</h4>

救主在赴十字架的路上呼喊说：「背起你的十字架跟从我」，但祂没有解释背十字架是何意义，直等祂自己经过死由坟墓中出来而进入生命，并升上高天，坐在至大者的右边时，纔将此阐明；从此借着祂所拣选的器皿保罗，解明了祂的十字架，并十字架在那些渴慕跟从祂的人身上的要求是甚么。

从那位忍受十字架的主口中所发出的来就十字架的呼召，今天仍响亮在每一个蒙救赎的人耳边，并且指示我们在现今的世界，这是跟从羔羊者惟一的道路。在福音书里面有五次记载主十字架的呼召，并且每一次都表示十字架在那些真实顺从这呼召的信徒生命中所有不同的光景：

<h4>十字架的道路是不可避免的</h4>

「凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒」(路十四27)。

十字架的道路对基督是不可避免的，祂曾经对尼哥底母说：「摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，人子也必照样被举起来」(约三14)。对祂的门徒说，祂「必须」去耶路撒冷受害并被杀。这「必须」一词是加重语。这条
路是羔羊的路，也是跟从祂的人的路。这「必须」一词怎样是主的加重语，也照样是跟从祂者的加重语，因为祂不是说过，凡拒绝十字架的人，不能作祂的门徒吗？基督既然为着救赎罪人背起十字架，学基督的人也必须背起基督的十字架，不然祂就无法教导他。

今日有许多神的儿女，他们知道基督曾背十字架，他们也知道借着基督的死得着了生命；但对基督背负的十字架也必须是他们的十字架这件事，却从未想到过。他们不知道有钉十字架的主，就必须有钉十字架的跟从者；一个真实跟从羔羊的人，只能借着死纔可以达到宝座；因为羔羊在地上只有一条路可走，就是被牵到宰杀之地的路；而在天上的宝座，只是为着被杀的羔羊预备的。

<h4>十字架的意义</h4>

「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我」(太十六24)。「就当舍己」(即否认自己)的意思，不是否认自己喜悦的事，也不是否认自己的罪，乃是否认自己，并「己」所包括的一切；以「己」为中心的源头，以「己」为起因的行动，以及一切以「己」为中心目标的外面事物。

拒绝「己」，纔是十字架的真实意义，任何其他的说法都限制了十字架宽广的意义，因为它将使整个各各他的拯救受到遮蔽，就如以后复活的主向使徒保罗所启示的。因为己乃是一切难处、背叛、自私、骄傲、与罪恶的中心；但愿人看见自己已经钉在十字架上，天天否认──拒绝承认──自己，并平静安稳的背起十字架，走在十字架的道路中。

<h4>十字架的深度</h4>

「就当舍己，背起他的十字架...因为凡要救自己生命的，必丧掉生命」(太十六24~25)。我们都同意弃绝我们的罪，但却要保留我们自己。因为我们没有看见「己」在人里面，完全像罪一样，是拦阻圣灵的，我们也没有看见那从首先的亚当而来的生命，会使耶稣的生命在我们这必死的身上受到遮蔽。

那么，究竟人所要救反而失丧的生命，是甚么样的生命呢？那我们本该恨恶却反而爱惜因而招致永远损失的生命，又是甚么样的生命呢？

在我们所引证的经文中，那些说到生命的地方，都是指着<b>魂生命</b>说的。主所要我们弃绝或恨恶的生命，就是我们从首先的亚当所得的生命(参林前十五45，47)。我们称它作「魂生命」。这生命与属天的生命有别，属天的生命乃是因着与从天而来的主联合得到的。在另一处主又称它为人「自己的生命」，人所以爱自己的生命，因为自己的生命是「己」的一部份。我们爱魂生命，因为魂是在感觉的范围里运行的，并且魂生命常是与属地的事相连的。

神的儿女在最初一段时间，这一种感觉魂的生命与从神而来的真实的生命是相混杂的，因此许多人的经历都是「波浪式」的。因此需要圣灵挥动圣灵的宝剑──神的话──将我们里面属魂的和属灵的完全分开。当神的话丰丰富富的住在我们里面，作分开的工作时，我们就要恨恶我们所看见的魂生命，并降服于十字架而弃绝它。

如果我们要跟随羔羊，让祂的生命显在我们身上，我们在人中间就是真实走主的道路，我们必须认识十字架的深度；如果我们要进入祂的死所有的一切福气里，我们就必须在我们这面否认、弃绝、恨恶一切出于我们「自己」的，并接受一切出于祂的。

我们弃绝自己有多少，我们认识祂复活的大能就有多少。我们弃绝我们的罪，就能与基督一同向那些罪死；我们弃绝世界，就能与基督一同向世界死；我们弃绝「自己」，就能让基督在我们里面掌权；照样，我们弃绝魂生命，祂的生命就要显在我们这必死的身上。

<h4>十字架与属地的缠累</h4>

「凡爱父母...儿女过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；不背着他的十字架跟从我的，也不配作我的门徒。得着生命的，将要失丧生命」(太十37~39)。在这里我们又看见十字架另一面的光景，并且看见弃绝魂生命是何意义。魂生命常会因着属地的缠累而受到厉害的捆绑。属地的缠累相当厉害，这需要十字架的死和圣灵更深的工作，把它们在主里带到合宜的地位。神那快利的剑要在属地的关系上刺入剖开人的魂与灵，因为跟随羔羊的道路绝不能有一点或一时受这些关系的阻碍，钉十字架的那一位是与属地的爱相冲突的。所以说「人的仇敌就是自己家里的人」，那些爱我们的手，也就是把我们钉在十字架上的手。主说：凡爱他自己所爱而过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒。一颗带着泪顺服的心，愿意跟随主，在主脚前使魂生命受捆绑，为着祂而失丧一切的人，要在天上得着喜乐的报偿。

<h4>十字架和承认基督</h4>

「凡把我和我的话当作可耻的，人子在祂父的荣耀里...降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的」(可八38)。这是马可记载主在呼召人就十字架时所说的话，就是当祂说到为着祂和福音的原故失丧生命时所说的；只有当我们背起基督的十字架，弃绝自己和魂生命，纔能从世界中出来，出到营外，忍受祂所受的凌辱。

主已预先知道十字架是绊跌人的，十字架的信息也是绊跌人的；祂向保罗所启示的福音乃是「十字架的道」。传讲基督是人的模范不是十字架，山上的教训在属地的人和天然的人是无法领会的。那迷惑人的，甚至会鼓励人去仿效山上的教训而生活，只要能使人离开十字架和大能的基督；撒但有时也给人外面的能力，使人好象是顺从天国的律法，只要它能使人接受一个没有耶稣基督十字架的福音。

<h4>天天的十字架</h4>

「就当舍己，天天背起他的十字架...凡要救自己(魂)生命的，必丧掉生命」(路九23~24)。保罗说：「身上常带着耶稣的死」。主说：「天天(时时)...」。我们从保罗的书信中看见与基督的死联合，就能使我们进入新生命的境界中，由此我们看见十字架成为我们与以往中间的鸿沟；并且我们也看见不断的模成基督的死，乃是在实际中让基督复活的生命继续显在我们身上的必须条件。

主吩咐跟从祂的人要天天背十字架，与后来启示给保罗的福音是完全吻合的。我们必须天天算自己已经与基督同钉十字架，并以钉十字架的主耶稣的心思武装我们，顺服至死。渐渐的，魂生命一天天的丧失了，主自己的生命就成了我们的生命。主呼召人天天背起他的十字架来，要天天，天天，天天。如果祂的儿女们在这个满有需要的世界上，真正成为钉十字架主的使者，就需要天天背起他的十字架。

<h4>十字架及其要求</h4>

「人到我这里来，若不恨恶(原文)自己的父母、妻子、弟兄、姊妹和他自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒。凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒...若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的门徒」(路十四26~27，33)。无条件的降服，是这一段经文的主旨。因为神是创造者，也是救赎者，所以祂有绝对的主权，得着一切我们所是和我们所有的。每一个字都是含意深长且是无限量的，父母、妻子、弟兄、姊妹，个个都必交给救赎主，这样纔能在主里有所得着并被祂得着；不只如此，救赎主还要求祂每一个救赎者的生命，因为信徒的生命乃是由主而来，所以他不再是自己的人。

「撇下一切所有的」，似乎是十字架对人要求的总结，因为在十字架上基督用自己的宝血买了我们，请记住，信徒虽是撇下了一切，但却要「在今世得着百倍，在来世得着永生」(可十29~30)。

简言之，我们若不否认──弃绝──自己，就是否认买我们的主，但如果我们能在圣灵的能力里看见耶稣的十字架，我们「自己的十字架」就算不得甚么了，并且我们要欢乐着忍受现在的苦楚，因为这苦楚比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。

<h3>传十字架</h4>

<h4>对十字架产生热爱</h4>

圣灵将各各他向人启示了出来，因此信徒里面就产生了一个对十字架的热爱，在心里像烧着的火(耶二十9)一样，深深的巴望使各各他的人子看见祂劳苦的功效而心满意足。这个渴望就成了主宰他生命的力量，并且吞灭了所有关于个人得失的意念。

这样一个热切的期望，从保罗的生活和话语中能清楚的看出来，尤其在他给哥林多人的书信中，当他写这书信的时候，他定意在他们中间不知道别的，「只知道耶稣基督并祂钉十字架」(林前二2)。他如
何因这个定意而抹杀自己的益处，在今天尊崇十字架的基督教环境里，我们是不大容易明白的，但在保罗那个时代，十字架却是刑罚极邪恶的犯罪者的刑具，所以是最可厌、也是最可怕的羞辱，像今天的绞架一样。

这的确需要神的启示，纔能使一个骄傲的法利赛人以十字架为荣耀，而不以这不可思议的福音为耻！难怪他们要说他疯狂了。但他对哥林多人说，不论怎样，我已定了主意，只传基督并祂钉十字架。

<h4>天然的人厌恶十字架</h4>

哥林多人虽有高深的学识，但在道德方面却是堕落的。他们从事哲学、文学的追求，但却落在罪恶之中。保罗为了使他的信息能被哥林多人接受，可能曾考虑到是否可以利用人的智慧和知识来赢得他们的信从。因为他曾受到比雅典更好的教育，并且在耶路撒冷曾按希伯来的律法受过训练，同时又是罗马公民，有地位，有权势，在属世的事上每一点他都可以与哥林多人相比，所以他想他很可以此来对付他们。「若是这样，那十字架讨厌的地方就没有了」(加五11)。

然而他慎重的放弃了属肉体的武器，而定意传这令人讨厌的钉十字架的弥赛亚，完全信托圣灵能使十字架的道成为神的大能；这样，所有相信的人只将信心的锚拋在神的能力上，而不是拋在人智慧的劝勉上。

保罗的这个定意给我们看见，他是怎样为着十字架的信息，完全弃绝了自己的荣耀。这样的十字架的使者是今日所需要的，今天神的使者所面临的抉择，也仍然是究竟应当使用肉体的兵器和智慧委婉的言语呢？还是把自己摆在神大能之下来见证这十字架的信息呢？

<h4>传十字架</h4>

「弟兄们...我到你们那里去，并没有用高言大智...我说的话，讲的道，不是用智慧委婉的言语」(林前二1，4)。使徒说他像一个被轻看的人，在哥林多人那里又软弱，又惧怕，又甚战兢的来传讲神的奥秘，但他所讲的道却是神「圣灵和大能的明证」。

传讲十字架的道，除非有圣灵作见证，不然就要变为绊脚石，因为在信息的背后，若没有圣灵的光照和叫人自责的能力，肉体是非的观念将拒绝十字架而转向别的福音，其实那并不是福音；有时头脑对于十字架的领会，也会麻醉人的良心，有些瞎眼的人甚至将十字架物质化，叫人崇拜一个外面十字架的记号和样式，因为仇敌清楚的知道，它可以藉此将人制服，除非人因着圣灵的能力而认识十字架的真实意义。

十字架的道并不需要人智慧的言语来显明它的能力，使徒说，如果使用人智慧的话语，反而使十字架落了空(林前一17)。这岂不正说出人对基督的死虽然有许多的知识，却在他们的生活上毫无真实改变的原因吗？传道人能使十字架落了空，这是何等可怕的事实！十字架是怎样因传道人智慧的言语落了空呢？这是因为传道人注重用人智慧所指教的言语，过于注重与祂的同死，智慧的言语叫人注意传道人过于所传的信息，叫人注意口才过于所讲的题目，叫人注意仆人过于注意所传的主。

各各他的信息是父神的信息，人虽传讲祂儿子的死，但却不能将丝毫的荣耀归给人。各各他的故事必须传讲，必须对这将亡的世界传讲它的危险和可怕，美丽的词藻对这信息是有害的，十字架这题目并非一首虚幻的诗词，因此无论在它的实质或传讲上，都没有地位给肉体夸口。

在保罗身上，我们看见传讲十字架有果效的必须条件是甚么。只有借着那些愿意与他们所传述的钉死的主同钉十字架的人，纔能将各各他的信息传开。传讲十字架需要有圣灵的见证，十字架的道是神向人所显明的能力，只有认识十字架能力的人纔能传讲。圣灵如何来见证神儿子的死和复活，我们可以在使徒行传中看到。曾站在各各他山下的人，纔能传讲各各他的信息；曾看见复活主的人，纔能见证祂的复活。

马丁路得说：「我觉得基督好象昨天纔死」。今日圣灵有一个特殊的工作，就是对十字架的使者启示基督的死，使基督的死对他们成为何等的真实。圣灵要将钉十字架的基督活画在那些祂所差遣的人里面，并且因十字架所产生的如火如荼的热心，将弃绝一切从人而来的称赞和非难，以忧伤的心来宣讲神儿子的死，乃是将亡之人惟一的盼望。

圣灵就是这样启示给保罗，使他只能呼喊说：「若不传福音，我便有祸了」。从神和那位「因摆在祂面前的喜乐，就忍受十字架，轻看羞辱」的观点来看各各他，一切的骄傲就都消失了，他选择来传十字架，即使他所传的十字架变成了他自己的十字架，使他被人轻看弃绝，像他的主所受的一样，他也愿意。

<h4>十字架的信息</h4>

「十字架的道...是神的大能」(林前一18)。这里「大能」一词，在希腊文中乃是指「爆炸力」；使徒说，十字架的道乃是神的炸力，不是内在的潜能，乃是显出来的一个动力。在各各他的十字架上，神曾以全力来拯救这个失丧和败坏了的世界，十字架的道对一切接受的人就是神行动的能力，因为有全能的神作它的后盾，主说：「我若被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我」。只有「十字架的道」(纯净简单的传讲基督的十字架)，不是关于十字架的一些推理，纔是神的能力。

今天神的仆人须面对一个问题，我们是确实相信神的能力在十字架信息里面呢？或是以为十字架的道需要许多话来解释呢？全能的神作了十字架信息的后盾，也在十字架信息的里面，因为它是神的能力，不止对罪人是如此，更是对我们这些相信得救的人。十字架的信息能应付人生活中各方面的需要，在每一属灵长进的过程中，在每一迫切的需要上，永远给以适切的帮助，永远不会枯竭，十字架是神的能力。

<h4>十字架的仇敌</h4>

「因为有许多人行事是基督十字架的仇敌，我屡次告诉你们，现在又流泪的告诉你们...他们专以地上的事为念」(腓三18~19)。十字架的信息会在一些人里面引起积极的反对，这样，他们就成了十字架的仇敌；因为所有对十字架的敌意都是起因于他们有所爱好，而十字架却宣告要他们从其中蒙拯救！那些爱慕地上事物的人，就是恨恶这样的信息，因为他们不愿舍弃他们所爱的那一切。

「十字架的仇敌」！传道人如只专注「智慧的言语」，就使所传的落了空；那些以外面事物为中心的人，将因十字架要求他们脱离属世的缠累而绊跌；那些贪爱属地事物的人，就被称为十字架的仇敌，因为他们的生活恰与十字架的目的相反。哦！何等严肃的事实！主是为救我们脱离自己而死的，而我们不仅借着智慧的言语为自己寻求荣耀，更因贪爱属地的事物，叫这信息落了空。我们枉作了十字架的使者！

<h4>重钉十字架</h4>

「他们把神的儿子重钉十字架，明明的羞辱祂」(来六6)。拋开上下文不看，只这一句就足够叫我们注意其严重性了，这是告诉我们神的儿子是会被人重钉十字架的，这次乃是被那些祂所救赎的人，就是那些尝过天恩滋味，曾答应祂呼召且得着祂生命的人所作的。

基督已胜过了世界和鬼魔的能力，世界和鬼魔已不能再对祂有任何作为，现在只有祂用血所买的人能将羔羊重钉十字架了，这是说出他们轻看恩典的圣灵，并甘愿再回到他们已经弃绝了的世界的污秽中去(彼后二20)，这就把那买他们的主明明的羞辱了。这段警戒的话乃是出之于向光照负责的问题。使徒彼得严肃的说：「他们晓得义路，竟背弃了传给他们的圣命，倒不如不晓得为妙」(彼后二21)。

哦！愿圣灵能将十字架的死启示给神的每一儿女，使我们在各各他的亮光里看见罪的可恶，并抵挡罪恶以至于死，当这末后的日子在一切蒙救赎者中作标记，使人深深的认识，如果我们这些由祂自己的血所买来的人再去犯罪，就是将神的儿子重钉十字架，使祂再一次受苦捆绑被杀了；然而祂却是「曾一次为罪受苦，就是义的代替不义的，为要引我们到神面前」(彼前三18)。

「必有人问祂说，你两臂中间是甚么伤呢？祂必回答说，这是我在亲友家中所受的伤」(亚十三6)。真的，当我们这作神儿女的人，不愿交通于祂的十字架，在我们心里或生活中，又贪爱那些祂曾以死拯救我们脱离了的事物时，或者拿犯罪不当作一回事，轻看恩典的圣灵，将那使祂成圣之约的血当作平常(来十29)，就是重新使祂受伤。

哦！神的儿女们当心不要受罪的迷惑，要小心，不要依恃神的恩典，以为祂会赦免，因此就接受最小的试探；也不要将罪当作软弱，就宽容你的失败；你应当敬虔的活在神面前，不要再沾染不洁。

<h3>在宝座中间的羔羊</h3>

<h4>死过又活的羔羊</h4>

在启示录的开头告诉我们，这是神赐给祂儿子耶稣基督的启示，叫祂将必要快成的事指示祂的众仆人，祂就差遣使者晓谕祂的仆人约翰。在向约翰所揭露的启示中，我们能清楚的看见各各他在天上的光景，和被弃绝的神的羔羊(就是那死在十字架上除去世人罪孽的羔羊)，所有的永远结局。

使徒以三而一神的名义写信给七个教会，称主为「从死里首先复活的」，在他信息的开头就将我们带回到各各他。约翰乃是写信给那班蒙主爱的人，祂曾用自己的血洗净了他们的罪(启一4~6)，并且从死里复活作了众弟兄中的首生者，进到天上，作为他们的先锋进入幔内，祂在天上作蒙救赎者的代表，祂为他们死了，也带着他们死了，使他们脱离了首先亚当的族类，成为一个新的属天的族类，在神面前为君王、为祭司，作神的后嗣，与基督同作后嗣。当约翰遇见这位人子时，他说他就仆倒在祂的脚前，祂的眼目如同火焰，他听见有声音──在地上曾一度对他是那么熟悉的声音──说：「不要惧怕，我是...那存活的，我曾死过，现在又活了，直活到永永远远」(启一17~18)。他曾见过祂受羞辱；曾摸过祂那被扎的手；也曾看过祂那有枪伤钉痕的身体；又曾看到祂升天。现在天开了，那死过的，现在又活了，直活到永永远远，并且祂掌握着死亡和阴间的钥匙。

在祂要使徒向众教会所传的信息内，主再一次对那些在苦难中的人亲切的题起祂是「死过又活的」(启二8)。祂曾受苦，并在苦难中得胜，因此祂告诉他们说「务要至死忠心」，就必得着冠冕。

<h4>惟羔羊配展开书卷</h4>

「看哪！在天上有门开了...」；「我又看见宝座...中间有羔羊站立，像是被杀过的」(启四1；五6)。这位荣耀的主再一次显露出来，天上的门开了，使徒「在灵里」被提到天上的中心，他看见主神全能者的宝座，他见有闪电，有声音，有雷轰，从宝座中发出；并看见宝座周围有敬拜的人，昼夜敬拜这位创造万有的主。天上的活物说：「圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，主神，全能者...你曾创造万物，并且万物是因你的旨意而被造的」(启四8~11)。

在主神创造者手中有「书卷」。地上罪恶的杯已经满溢了，创造者定意在日期满足的时候，将恩典的时代结束，而开始审判那些背叛的人。在天上有声宣告说，「谁配展开那书卷」？谁配完成祂永远的目的？至高的神能将对付这个背逆世界的庄严托付交给谁呢？在天上没有一人配展开，就是神的天使长也不配。那么谁能展开这书卷呢？但约翰却看见在神的宝座中间──「有羔羊站立」(启五6)。父已「将审判的事全交与子，叫人都尊敬子如同尊敬父一样」(约五22~23)。子曾为救罪人舍去自己的命，只有祂配审判那些不听从福音的人(帖后一8~9)。这位在宝座中间的羔羊是「站立的，像是刚被杀过的」。各各他的祭牲是常新的，安放在天的中心，活显在天上万物面前。

<h4>在审判中的羔羊</h4>

「祂拿了书卷」(启五7)。祂将书卷握在祂被扎的手中，这意义真是深厚；难怪在天上那些蒙救赎者，当他们看见祂以羔羊的身位成全了父的旨意时，就唱说：「你配拿书卷...你曾被杀，用自己的血从各族、各方、各民、各国买了人来归于神」。千万的天使也大声说：「曾被杀的羔羊是配...」，一切被造之物也都说：「愿颂赞、尊贵、荣耀、权势都归给坐宝座的和羔羊，直到永永远远」(启五9~14)。这位曾在各各他被钉死的羔羊，已经得了荣耀，天上一切的敬拜都以祂为中心。今天在天上关于祂工作的显示，都是根据祂在十字架上的牺牲。在天上祂是那位在各各他得胜的主，是在十字架上得胜的羔羊，父神将揭开每一印的权柄赐给了祂，叫祂在弃绝祂的地上施行审判。父将一切审判都交在那位为世人作了罪的代替的主的手中。

在圣洁的神的眼中，人最大的罪乃是轻看并拒绝神为人类的罪而预备的赎罪牺牲。羔羊爱罪人，为罪人的缘故受尽痛苦和羞辱，舍了祂的命，难道现在还不配向这个罪恶的世界施行审判，表明在公义的神面前是无法宽容的吗？因为地被罪玷污了，所以基督就为罪人的原故献上了祂的生命，从神获得了恩免，现在这一切都已过去，祂也将一切「执政的，掌权的，有能的都毁灭了，就把国交与父神」(林前十五24~28)。

当审判临到时，地上惊恐的万民并不需要别人告诉他们，这审判乃是因他们弃绝了钉十字架的神的羔羊，因为他们大声的呼号，大山小山压在他们身上隐藏他们，不只躲避造他们的主，也躲避羔羊的忿怒。当这爱与怜悯被弃绝时，谁能探测因此而引起的忿怒的深度？

<h4>羔羊是元帅</h4>

「因为宝座中的羔羊必牧养他们」(启七17)。羔羊在地上被杀，但在天上却登上了宝座，不仅成为天上敬拜的中心，也成为地上审判之印的开启者，并且是蒙救赎之人的首领。

地上那些因恐惧而战兢的人，知道是他们杀害了羔羊，但在天上那些蒙救赎的人，也知道他们所以能在那里乃是借着祂。第一幅图画给我们看见的是四活物和长老，当他们看见羔羊拿了书卷，开启前六印的时候，就说祂是用自己的血买了人来归给神(启五9)。此后我们又看见有无数的人，是从各国、各族、各民、各方选来的，他们站在宝座前昼夜事奉神，坐宝座的要用帐幕覆庇他们，他们的衣裳被血洗白净了，并且那忍受十字架的羔羊，已成为他们的牧人，要领他们到生命的泉源，他们的苦难已经过去，神自己要擦去他们一切的眼泪(启七9~17)。

我们看见羔羊站在另一班人的前面，这班人是有一定数目的，也是从地上人间买来的，羔羊无论往那里去，他们都跟随祂(启十四1~4)。

<h4>羔羊是战士</h4>

「他们与羔羊争战，羔羊必胜过他们」(启十七14)。当七印被揭开时，一个审判就接着一个审判临到地上，灾祸的号筒也吹响了，罪孽是越演越烈，直到求神伸冤的声音从坛的四角出来(启九13)。在旧约的豫表里，金坛的角都要用血(就是在铜祭坛上所献牺牲的血)涂抹，因这血可获得神的赦免，但现在这声音却呼求神施行审判。

现在神所设立的赦免之路已被摆在一边，而恩典救赎的神圣制度和救恩已被拒绝。人类的罪行已亵渎的宣告反对神和好的计划，地上的邪恶已起来敌挡神，尤其反对十字架，因此那本来呼求怜悯的金坛，今天反被迫呼求伸冤了。

背逆的人们竟成了撒但权势使用的工具；他们喝醉了圣徒的血，全力起来抵挡羔羊。但有一队战士出现，就是那些从与罪恶争战中出来的得胜者，有羔羊作他们的首领。十字架上被杀的羔羊乃是「万主之主，万王之王」。祂是各各他的战胜者，祂确保能得胜，并且那些蒙召被选有忠心的，在这大争战中与祂在一起的战士们也必得胜(启十七14)。

在羔羊与所有抵挡神和祂的受膏者最后的争战过去之后，天上就有大声，好象众水的声音说：「主神全能者作王了」(启十九6)；「我们将荣耀归给祂，因为羔羊婚娶的时候到了」(启十九7)。

那在十字架上得胜，呼召祂所赎回的人从各国、各方出来的基督，现在已得到最后的胜利，将一切执政的、掌权的都伏在祂脚下，祂舍命的最终目的已经完成了，因为祂「爱教会，为教会舍己...可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病」；「蒙恩得穿光明洁白的细麻衣，就是圣徒所行的义」。

又见天开了，各各他的人子出现了，祂眼睛如火焰，天上众军穿著又洁又白的细麻衣，跟随着祂。

祂是来占有这个被征服了的地，祂要在这里作王，魔鬼要被捆绑一千年，世上的国要成为我主和主基督的国，那些蒙救赎的君尊的祭司，要与主作王一千年(启十九1~6)。

这些事以后，约翰又看见永世的光景，有一个白色大宝座，和最末了的仇敌──死──的遭毁灭。

又看见新妇的城自神那里降下，「就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫」。先前的天地已经过去了，坐宝座的说：「看哪！我将一切都更新了」。但在这里是否各各他就被忘记了呢？没有。那位死而复活者的名字仍是「羔羊」。基督其他的名字在这荣耀丰满的异象中都不需要了。所有的名号都消失在这个超绝的名里了，羔羊这名世世代代永远新鲜。那些与主在地上同受试探的蒙拣选的使徒的名字刻在圣城的根基上，因为他们在人的嘲笑和背逆下传扬了十字架的信息，立下了教会的根基，除了那些名字从创世以来就记在被杀羔羊生命册上的人，都与圣城无分(启十三8)。那些以祂的十字架为夸耀并接受因祂的死而来的生命的，都要被模成羔羊的形像。

「我未见城内有殿，因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿」；「神的荣耀光照，又有羔羊为城的灯」；「有神和羔羊的宝座，祂的众仆人都要事奉祂，也要看见祂的面」(启廿一22~23；廿二3~4)。
