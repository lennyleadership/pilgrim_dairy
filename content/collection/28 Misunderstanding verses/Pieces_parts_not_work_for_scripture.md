Matthew 7:7: “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."  

John 14:14: "You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."  

John 15:7: "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."  

John 15:16: "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you."  

**John 16:16, 23-24:** Jesus went on to say, “In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me.”   

23 In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.   
24 Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete."  

**James 4:2-3:** You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. 
3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.  

**1 John 3:21-22:** Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God.  
22 and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.

**1 John 5:14-15:** This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.  
15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.
