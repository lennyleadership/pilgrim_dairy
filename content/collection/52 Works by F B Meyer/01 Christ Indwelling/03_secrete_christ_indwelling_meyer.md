&emsp;IT IS APPROPRIATE that the largest church in the greatest Gentile city in the world should be dedicated to the apostle Paul, for Gentiles are under a great obligation to him as the Apostle of the Gentiles. It is to him that we owe, under the Spirit of God, the unveiling of two great mysteries, which especially touch us as Gentiles.   

&emsp;The first of these, glorious as it is, we cannot now discuss, although it wrought a revolution when first preached and maintained by the apostle in the face of the most strenuous opposition. Till then, Gentiles were expected to become Jews before they were Christians, and to pass through the synagogue to the church. But Paul showed that this was not needful, and that Gentiles stood on the same level as Jews with respect to the privileges of the gospel—fellow-heirs, fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel (Ephesians 3:6).   

&emsp;The second, however, well deserves our further thought, for if only it could be realized by the children of God, they would begin to live after so divine a fashion as to still the enemy and avenger and to repeat in some small measure the life of Jesus on the earth. The mystery is that the Lord Jesus is willing to dwell within the Gentile heart. That He should dwell in the heart of a child of Abraham was deemed a marvelous act of condescension; but that He should find a home in the heart of a Gentile was unbelievable. This mistake was, however, dissipated before the radiant revelation of truth made to him who, in his own judgment, was not fit to be called an apostle, because he had persecuted the church of God. God was pleased to make known through him “the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27).   

&emsp;“Master, where dwellest thou?” they asked of old. And in reply Jesus led them from the crowded Jordan bank to the slight tent of woven willows where He temporarily lodged. But if we address the same question to Him now, He will point not to the high and lofty dome of heaven, not to the splendid structure of stone or marble, but to the happy spirit that loves, trusts, and obeys Him. “Behold,” says He, “I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.” “We will come,” He said, including His Father with Himself, “and make our abode with him.” He promised to be within each believer as a tenant in a house as sap in the branch, as life blood and life energy in each member, however feeble, of the body.   

### The Mystery   
&emsp;Christ is in the believer. He indwells the heart by faith, as the sun indwells the lowliest flowers that unfurl their petals and bare their hearts to its beams. Not because we are good. Not because we are trying to be wholehearted in our consecration. Not because we keep Him by the tenacity of our love. But because we believe, and in believing, have thrown open all the doors and windows of nature. And He has come in.   

&emsp;He probably came in so quietly that we failed to detect His entrance. There was no footfall along the passage. The chime of the golden bells at the foot of His priestly robe did not betray Him. He stole in on the wing of the morning, or like the noiselessness with which nature arises from her winter’s sleep and arrays herself in the robes that her Creator has prepared for her. But this is the way of Christ. He does not strive, or cry, or cause His voice to be heard. His tread is so light that it does not break bruised reeds. His breath is so soft that it can reillumine dying sparks. Do not be surprised, therefore, if you cannot tell the day or the hour when the Son of Man came to dwell within you. Only know that He has come. “Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2 Corinthians 13:5).   

&emsp;It is very wonderful. The heavens, even the heavens of heavens, with all their light and glory, alone seem worthy of Him. But even there He is not more at home than He is with the humble and contrite spirit that simply trusts in Him. In His early life, He said that the Father dwelt in Him so truly that the words He spoke and the works He did were not His own, but His Father’s. And He desires to be in us as His Father was in Him, so that the outgoings of our life may be channels through which He, hidden within, may pour Himself forth upon men.   

&emsp;It is not generally recognized. That does not disprove it. We fail to recognize many things in ourselves and in nature around us that are nevertheless true. But there is a reason that many, whose natures are certainly the temple of Christ, remain ignorant of the presence of the wonderful Tenant who sojourns within. He dwells so deep. Below the life of the body, which is as the curtain of the tent; below the life of the soul, where thought and feeling, judgment and imagination, hope and love go to and fro, ministering as white-stoled priests in the holy place; below the play of light and shade, resolution and will, memory and hope, the perpetual ebb and flow of the tides of self consciousness, there, through the Holy Spirit, Christ dwells, as of old the Shekinah dwelt in the Most Holy Place, closely shrouded from the view of man.   

&emsp;It is comparatively seldom that we go into these deeper departments of our being. We are content to live the superficial life of sense. We eat, we drink, we sleep. We give ourselves to enjoy the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. We fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the mind. Or we abandon ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge and culture, of science and art. We make short incursions into the realm of morals, that sense of right and wrong that is part of the makeup of men. But we have too slight an acquaintance with the deeper and more mysterious chamber of the spirit. This is why the majority of believers are so insensible of their divine and wonderful Resident, who makes the regenerated spirit His abode. 

&emsp;It is to be accepted by faith. We repeat here our constant mistake about the things of God. We try to feel them. If we feel them, we believe them; otherwise, we take no account of them. We reverse the divine order. We say feeling, FAITH, FACT. God says FACT, FAITH, feeling. With Him feeling is of small account—He only asks us to be willing to accept His own Word, and to cling to it because He has spoken it, in entire disregard of what we may feel.   

&emsp;I am distinctly told in Scripture that Christ, though He is on the throne in His ascended glory, is also within me by the Holy Spirit. I confess I do not feel Him there. Often amidst the assault of temptation or the fury of the storm that sweeps over the surface of my nature, I cannot detect His form or hear Him say, “It is I.” But I dare to believe He is there; not without me, but within; not as a transient sojourner for a night, but as a perpetual inmate; not altered by my changes from earnestness to lethargy, from the summer of love to the winter of despondency, but always and unchangeably the same. And I say again and again, “Jesus, You are here. I am not worthy that You should abide under my roof; but You have come. Assert Yourself. Put down all rule, and authority, and power. Come out of Your secret chamber, and possess all that is within me, that it may bless Your holy name.   

&emsp;Catherine of Siena at one time spent three days in a solitary retreat, praying for a greater fullness and joy of the divine presence. Instead of this, it seemed as though legions of wicked spirits assailed her with blasphemous thoughts and evil suggestions. At length, a great light appeared to descend from above. The devils fled, and the Lord Jesus conversed with her. Catherine asked Him, “Lord, where wert Thou when my heart was so tormented?”   

&emsp;“I was in thy heart,” He answered.   

&emsp;“O Lord, Thou art everlasting truth,” she replied, “and I humbly bow before Thy word; but how can I believe that Thou wast in my heart when it was filled with such detestable thoughts?”   

&emsp;“Did these thoughts give thee pleasure or pain?” He asked.  

&emsp;“An exceeding pain and sadness,” was her reply.   

&emsp;The Lord said, “Thou wast in woe and sadness because I was in the midst of thy heart. My presence it was which rendered those thoughts insupportable to thee. When the period I had determined for the duration of the combat had elapsed, I sent forth the beams of My light, and the shades of hell were dispelled, because they cannot resist that light.”  

### The Glory of This Mystery   

&emsp;When God’s secrets break open, they do so in glory. The wealth of the root hidden in the ground is revealed in the hues of orchid or scent of rose. The hidden beauty of a beam of light is unraveled in the sevenfold color of the rainbow. The swarming, infinitesimal life of southern seas breaks into waves of phosphorescence when cleft by the keel of the ship. And whenever the unseen world has revealed itself to mortal eyes, it has been in glory. It was especially so at the Transfiguration, when the Lord’s nature broke from the strong restraint within which He had confined it and revealed itself to the eye of man. “His face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light” (Matthew 17:2).  

&emsp;So when we accept the fact of His existence deeper within us than our own and make it one of the aims of our life to draw on it and develop it, we shall be conscious of a glory transfiguring our life and irradiating ordinary things, which will make earth, with its commonest engagements, like the vestibule of heaven.   

&emsp;The wife of Jonathan Edwards had been the subject of great fluctuations in religious experience and frequent depression till she came to the point of renouncing the world and yielding herself up to be possessed by these mighty truths. But as soon as this was the case, a marvelous change took place. She began to experience a constant, uninterrupted rest; sweet peace and serenity of soul; a continual rejoicing in all the works of God’s hands, whether of nature or of daily providence; a wonderful access to God by prayer, as it were seeing Him and immediately conversing with Him; all tears wiped away; all former troubles and sorrows of life forgotten, except grief for past sins and for the dishonor done to Christ in the world; a daily sensible doing and suffering everything for God and doing all with a continual uninterrupted cheerfulness, peace, and joy.   

&emsp;Such glory - the certain pledge of the glory to be revealed—is within reach of each reader of these lines who will dare day by day to reckon that Christ lives within and will be content to die to the energies and prompting for the self-life so that there may be room for the Christ-life to reveal itself. “I am crucified with Christ,” said the greatest human teacher of this divine art; “Christ liveth in me … I live by the faith of the Son of God” (Galatians 2:20).   

### The Riches of the Glory of This Mystery.  
&emsp;When this mystery or secret of the divine life in man is apprehended and made use of, it gives great wealth to life. If all the treasures of wisdom, knowledge, power, and grace reside in Jesus, and He has become the cherished and honored resident of our nature, it is clear that we also must be greatly enriched. It is like a poor man having a millionaire friend come to live with him.   

&emsp;There are riches of patience. Life is not easy to any of us. No branch escapes the pruning knife; no jewel the wheel; no child the rod. People tyrannize and vex us almost beyond endurance. Circumstances strain us till the chords of our hearts threaten to snap. Our nervous system is overtaxed by the rush and competition of our times. Indeed, we have need of patience.   

&emsp;Never to relax the self-watch; never to indulge in unkind or thoughtless criticism of others; never to utter the hasty word or permit the sharp retort; never to complain except to God; never to permit hard and distrustful thoughts to lodge within the soul; to be always more thoughtful of others than self; to detect the one blue spot in the clouded sky; to be on the alert to find an excuse for those who are forward and awkward; to suffer the aches and pains, the privations and trials of life, sweetly, submissively, trustfully; to drink the bitter cup, with the eye fixed on the Father’s face, without a murmur or complaint: this needs patience, which mere stoicism could never give.   

&emsp;And we cannot live such a life till we have learned to avail ourselves of the riches of the indwelling Christ. The beloved apostle speaks of being a partaker of the patience that is in Jesus (Revelation 1:9). So may we be. That calm, unmurmuring, unreviling patience, which made the Lamb of God dumb before His shearers, is ours.   

&emsp;Robert Hall was once overheard saying amid the heat of an argument, “Calm me, O Lamb of God!”   

&emsp;But we may go further and say, “Lord Jesus, let Your patience arise in me, as a spring of fresh water in a briny sea.”   

&emsp;There are riches of grace. Alone among the great cities of the world, Jerusalem had no river. But the glorious Lord was in the midst of her, and He became a place of broad rivers and streams, supplying from Himself all that rivers gave to cities at the foot of whose walls the welcome water lapped.   

&emsp;This is a picture of what we have, who dare to reckon on the indwelling of our glorious Lord, as King, Lawgiver, and Savior. He makes all grace to abound toward us so that we have a sufficiency for all emergencies and can abound in every good work. In His strength, ever rising up within us, we are able to do as much as those who are endowed with the greatest mental and natural gifts, and we escape the temptations to vainglory and pride by which they are beset.   

&emsp;The grace of purity and self-control, of fervent prayer and understanding in the Scriptures, of love for men and zeal for God, of lowliness and meekness, of gentleness and goodness—all is in Christ; and if Christ is in us, all is ours also. Oh, that we would dare to believe it, and draw on it, letting down the pitcher of faith into the deep well of Christ’s indwelling, opened within us by the Holy Spirit!   

&emsp;It is impossible, in these brief limits, to elaborate further this wonderful thought. But if only we would meet every call, difficulty, and trial, not saying, as we so often do, “I shall never be able to go through it,” but saying, “I cannot; but Christ is in me, and He can,” we should find that all trials were intended to reveal and unfold the wealth hidden within us, until Christ was formed within us and His life manifested in our mortal body (Colossians 1:27).   

### How do we become more conscious of His life within us?   
&emsp;1. Be still each day for a short time, sitting before God in meditation, and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you the truth of Christ’s indwelling. Ask God to be pleased to make known to you what is the riches of the glory of this mystery (Colossians 1:27).   

&emsp;2. Reverence your nature as the temple of the indwelling Lord. As the Easterner bares his feet, and the Westerner his head, on entering the limit of a temple, so be very careful of anything that would defile the body or soil the soul. No beasts must be herded in the temple courts. Get Christ to drive them out. “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God? … The temple of God is holy, which ye are” (1 Corinthians 3:16–17).   

&emsp;3. Hate your own life. “If any man … hate … not his own life,” said our Lord, “he cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:26). And the word translated “life” is soul, the seat and center of the self-life with its restless energies and activities, its choices and decisions, its 22 ceaseless strivings at independence and leadership. This is the greatest hindrance to our enjoyment of the indwelling Christ. If we will acquire the habit of saying no not only to our bad but to our good self; if we will daily deliver ourselves up to death for Jesus’ sake; if we will take up our cross and follow the Master, though it be to His grave, we shall become increasingly conscious of being possessed by a richer, deeper, more divine life than our own.

<div id="chinese" class="tabcontent">

&emsp;把世界上最大的外邦城市中，那一座最庞大的教堂献给使徒保罗，是恰当的，因为所有的外邦人都受过这位外邦人使徒的大恩。也是因着他在神的灵感之下，才把两个特别关及我们外邦人的大奥秘显明出来。

&emsp;第一个大奥秘虽然极其荣耀，可是我们不能在此详加讨论。当这位使徒首次宣讲这个大奥秘时，曾遭遇到最顽强的反对，但他仍坚持这立场。这是一个革命，在此以前，外邦人必须先作犹太人，才能成为基督徒；要经过犹太会堂，才能进入教堂。但是，他指出这是不必要的。同时，他又说明外邦人和犹太人在福音的特权上，是站于同等的地位--在基督耶稣里，藉着福音，得以同为后嗣，同为一体，同蒙应许(弗三6)。

&emsp;第二个大奥秘是我们要深入思想的。因为神的儿女若能了解这奥秘，就可以过一个象样的圣洁生活，以使仇敌的闭口无言，同时，亦会把耶稣在世的生活，再次活现出来。

&emsp;这奥秘是：<mark class = "lemon">主耶稣愿意住在外邦人心中</mark>。神愿意居住在亚伯拉罕的子孙心内，这事已足够是一件不可思议的奇妙降卑的作为；现在祂竟然肯以外邦人的心为居所，这更难以令人置信。可是，这错误的看法，在所启示给他的那荣耀真理面前，全被驱散了。依保罗自己的看法，他是不配作使徒的，因为他曾逼迫神的教会。然而，神却喜欢藉着他使人知道：「这奥秘在外邦人中有何等丰盛的荣耀，就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。」(西一27)  

&emsp;以前他们问祂：「拉比，在那里住？」耶稣领他们离开拥挤的约旦河畔，来到那用柳条编成的卑微帐篷，就是祂暂时寄宿的地方，作为回答。倘若我们现在向祂提出同样的问题，祂不会指向天上的住处，或那以大理石砌成的、壮丽宏伟的大殿堂，而是指向那爱祂、信靠祂和顺服祂的喜乐心灵。主说：「看哪！我站在门外叩门，若有听见我声音就开门的，我要进到他那里去。」祂又把父包括在内，说，：「我们要到他那里去，与他同在。」祂应许要居住在每个信徒心内，好像房客住在房子里；好像树汁液住在树枝内；好像生命的血与生命的能力住在身体每个肢体内，不管那肢体如何卑微软弱。  
  
  
### 〖 1. 这奥秘 〗  
  
&emsp;基督在信徒里面。祂藉着信徒的信，住在他们里面，好像太阳住在那向它吐放花瓣的最微小的花朵里面一样。不是因为我们的良善，亦不是因为我们愿意全心献上自己，更不是因为我们以坚强的爱来保有祂，乃是因为我们的信。而藉着这信的行动，我们把自己本质里所有的门户和窗扉，都大大开放，主也就进入我们心内。  

&emsp;可能祂是悄悄的进来，我们根本没有察觉到，亦没有听见祂脚步走过的声音。祂身上祭司袍上的小金钟，和谐的响声也没有惊动我们。祂好像乘驾着清晨的翅膀，如同大自然从冬眠中无声无息的复苏，披上造物主为她预备的华丽彩衣一样，静悄悄的进入。这就是基督的方法。祂不争竞，从不呼喊，亦从不扬声疾呼，望人听见。祂的步履轻巧得不会折断压伤的芦苇，祂的气息平和得不会吹灭将残的灯火。因此，你若不能说出人子在何时何刻，进入你心内居住，千万不要惊奇。只要知道祂已居住在你心内便足够了。「岂不知你们若不是可弃绝的，就有耶稣基督在你们心里么？」(林后十三5)  

&emsp;这奥秘非常奇妙。是的，诸天，甚至天上的天，连同它们的众光与荣耀，才似配得上祂。然而，即使在那荣美的地方，祂仍不觉得比跟那单纯信靠祂，心灵痛悔谦卑的人同住，更舒适愉快。主耶稣在世上的时候，祂说父在祂里面，所以，祂所说的话和祂所作的事，都不是凭着祂自己，乃是凭着祂的父。同时，祂要住在我们里面，如同父住在祂里面，以致我们的生活作息，成为流通的管道，让隐藏在我们里面的主，能把祂自己倾倒给人群。  

&emsp;这奥秘不被一般人所认识，但这却不能否定它的真实性。在我们自己身上，和自然界中，有许多事物我们都认识，但它们却是真实的。许多人从他们的本质上看，明显是基督的圣殿，但对这位居住心内的奇妙住客的存在，竟一无所知。这是有一个特别的理由的：因为祂居住在极深之处。在肉体生命之深处，这肉体生命乃是帐篷的帘子；在心灵生命之深处，这心灵生命乃是思想和情感、判断与幻想、希望与爱活动之处。祂好像穿上袍子的祭司，在圣所服事；在光与暗、决心和意志、记忆与希望的交替里、在自我意识不断的涨潮和退潮之间，基督藉着圣灵住在我们心内，好像旧日神的荣耀居住在至圣所内，封密不为人所见一样。  

&emsp;比较来说，我们很少进入自己这比较深入的部分。我们仅仅满足于生活在感观肤浅的生命中：吃、喝、睡。我们放纵自己于肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲和今生的骄傲。我们只求满足肉体和心智的愿望，或沉迷于追求知识和文化，科学与文艺。至于那构成人的基本要素，就是道德领域，和是非感，我们只是稍微触及而已。我们对自己灵里较深入、较奥秘的部分，认识得太少，这就是为什么大部分信徒感觉不到心中这位神圣，奇妙的住客，这位只以重生者的灵作自己居所的基督之原因。  

&emsp;这奥秘必须以信心接受。让我在此再重述一遍，我们对神的事情所常犯的错误：我们试图去感觉神的事情。若我们感觉得到就相信，否则就认为它们不存在。我们把神的次序颠倒了。我们的次序是：感觉，信心，事实；神的次序却是：事实，信心，感觉。在神来看，感觉算不得什么--祂只要我们愿意接受祂的话语，因为是祂所说的话，所以我们就坚信不移，全然不管我们的感觉如何。  

&emsp;神的话明确的告诉我，基督虽然高升到荣耀的宝座上，但同时亦藉着圣灵居住在我里面。我承认自己感觉不到祂在那里。常常在试探的攻击中，或在吹袭我本性表面的狂风暴雨中，我察觉不到祂的踪影，亦听不到祂的声音说：「是我。」然而，我却敢于相信，祂确在那里，不是在我身外，是在我里面；不是留宿一夜的过路客，乃是永久的密友；祂不因我从热忱变作麻木，从夏日般灼热的爱，退为冬日的沮丧而有所更改，祂永远一样，丝毫不变。我一再的说：「主耶稣，你在这里。我实在不配，你却住在我的屋檐下，你已经进来。请坚持你的地位，颁布你的律例、权柄和能力。请你从那隐秘的密室出来，支配在我里面的一切，使你的圣名可以得荣耀。」  

<div class = "quote">

&emsp;西艾那的圣迦他林(Catherine of Siena)，曾有一次独自退修三天，祈求得着神更丰盛的同在和喜乐。可是，所得到的似乎却是大批的邪灵，以亵渎的思想和罪恶的念头攻击她。很久以后，才有大光从天上降下。撒旦逃跑了，主耶稣来跟她谈话。   

&emsp;圣迦他林问主说：「主阿，当我的心受到这些折磨时，你在哪里呢？」  

&emsp;祂回答：「我在你心里。」  

&emsp;「主阿，你是永恒的真理」。她回答说：「在你的话语前，我只有谦卑俯伏。可是，我怎能相信在我内心充满了这些可憎恶的思想时，你仍然在我心内呢？」  

&emsp;主问她：「这些思想给予你的是喜乐或是痛苦？」  

&emsp;她这样回答主：「非常痛苦，而且极度难过。」  

&emsp;主对她说：「你之所以感到悲伤痛苦，乃是因为我在你心内，我的同在才令你对邪恶的思想产生难受的感觉。当我为你所定的争战时间一过去，我就发出我的光，驱散地狱的黑暗，因为它们不能抵抗那光。」  
</div>

  
### 〖 2. 这奥秘的荣耀 〗  
  
&emsp;神的奥秘都是在荣耀里展开的。植物的根部隐藏在地底下，它的丰富却在兰花缤纷的颜色里，或在玫瑰馥郁的磬香中显明出来。光所蕴藏着的美，在彩虹的七种颜色里表露了。南海中的那些微细的浮游生物，在破浪前进的轮船前，发出荧荧燐光。无论何时，那看不见的世界在人的肉眼前显明出来时，总是在荣耀里显明的。特别在主改变形象事上，那时主的本质突破了肉身的限制，在人的肉眼前显露。「祂的脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。」  

&emsp;所以，我们若接受主住在我们里面的深处，比我们自己的生命更深之处的这事实，又以支取祂，扩展祂为我们一生的目标时，就会发现，这事实可以改变我们的生命，使平凡事物璨然散发光芒；使地上最平凡的事物，全变为像天堂门庭一样的荣耀。  

&emsp;爱德华滋· 约拿单(Jonathan Edwards)的妻子，曾经在宗教经验上有很大的起伏，并经常陷入低潮。直到最后，她才完全摒弃了世界，把自己交托给这些大能的真理。当她这样作时，事情立刻有了奇妙的变化。她开始经历到持久而不间断的安息，心灵恬静平宁，不断享受神手中的作为，或是在大自然中，或是在日常生活之内，又藉着祈祷亲近神，就像亲眼见到祂，与祂直接交谈一样；一切眼泪都被抹干；除了为自己过去的罪孽，和为世界给主基督的各种凌辱痛心之外，旧日的烦恼，以及人生旅途中的一切忧伤，都全然被忘掉；天天的行事为人，或是受苦，都是为了神；她可以无间断的欢愉，平安与喜乐地去作各种事情。  

&emsp;这样的荣耀是必定要显明出来的，也是每一个读者都能获得的，只要我们敢于天天认定基督住在我们里面，并且甘心舍弃自我生命中的能力和激励，以使基督的生命能彰显出来。「我已经与基督同钉十字架。」在这门神圣的艺术上，那位最伟大的教师说：「基督在我里面活着 ……我是因信神的儿子而活。」  
  
  
### 〖 3. 这奥秘的丰盛荣耀 〗  
  
&emsp;人若领悟了神的生命居住在人里面的这个奥秘，而又使用这住在里面的生命时，就会给我们的生命带来无穷的财富。倘若一切的智慧、知识、能力和恩慈都住在耶稣里面，而祂又住在我们本性里面，且为我们所珍惜、所尊重，那么，很显明的，我们亦必大大蒙受恩惠，好像一个穷汉，有家财百万的好友来与他同住一样。  

&emsp;这奥秘有丰盛的忍耐。生命对任何人都非易事，没有枝子能逃过剪刀的修理；没有宝石能逃避磨石的齿轮；没有孩童能逃过管教的棒子。人们压制我们，困扰我们，几乎超越我们所能忍受的。环境的压力使我们的心弦几乎折断。我们这时代的忙碌生活和竞争的强烈，使我们的神经系统几乎负荷不了。是的，我们需要忍耐。  

&emsp;千万不要在谨慎自守的事上有任何的松懈；不要纵容自己，苛刻无情地批评别人；说话不要轻率，不要尖酸地回嘴；除了向神申述以外，不向任何人发怨言；内心不要存不信任他人的思想；要多为别人着想，少为自己；在乌云满布的天空中，总要设法寻找那一小片蔚蓝的晴天；要找理由原谅那些刚愎自用，麻烦多多的人；要愉快，顺服和信靠地忍受生命的痛苦忧伤；喝苦杯时，没有半点牢骚，没有半句怨言，惟有定睛在天父的脸上--这都需要忍耐，这种忍耐无法用斯多亚学派的坚忍来获得的。  

&emsp;除非我们学会使用基督住在我们里面的那丰盛，否则便不可能活出这样的生活。主所爱的那位使徒谈论到在忍耐上与主一同有分(启一9)。我们亦可以如此。那种平静、无怨言、无诽谤的忍耐，就是使神的羔羊在剪毛之人手下无声的忍耐，也可以成为我们的忍耐。  

&emsp;有一次，在激烈的争论中，有人听到贺尔罗拔(Robert Hall)低声地说：「神的羔羊啊，请使我安静下来。」  

&emsp;但是我们可以更进一步的说：「主耶稣，愿你的忍耐在我里面兴起，如同淡水泉在海中涌喷一样。」  

&emsp;这奥秘有丰盛的恩典。在世界各大城市中，惟独耶路撒冷没有河流。但是荣耀的主却在它中间，亲自成为江河宽阔之地。凡是河流所能供给城市的一切好处，祂都亲自供给耶路撒冷(赛三十三21)。  

&emsp;这一幅图画也描绘了我们这群敢于认定我们荣耀的主是王，是律法颁布者，是救主，敢于相信祂居住在我们里面的人所享有的福气。祂把诸般的恩典，丰丰富富的加给我们，所以我们能应付一切危机，又能多作善工。藉着祂在我们里面不断涌出的能力，凡是那些最有智慧和最有天然恩赐的人所能完成的工作，我们也都能完成。我们还比他们有一个好处，因为我们能避免他们所逃不掉的那些虚荣与骄傲的试探。  

&emsp;清洁和自制的恩典，热心祷告和明白圣经的恩典，爱人和为神发热心的恩典，谦卑和温柔的恩典，恩慈和良善的恩典--这一切都在基督里；若基督在我们里面，这一切也都全属我们所有。哦！愿我们敢于相信这事实，敢于支取它，把信心的桶子垂入住在我们里面的基督里，到基督藉圣灵在我们里面挖掘成的深井里，汲取这一切恩典。  

&emsp;在这短短的篇幅中，无法进一步把这奇妙的思想发挥得更透彻。然而，在面对呼召、困难和试炼时，只要我们不照一贯的习惯说：「我一定没办法承受得了！」而是说：「我不能；但基督在我里面，祂能。」这么样，便会发觉到一切试炼，都是为了显明隐藏在我们里面的财富，直至基督完全成形在我们里面，祂的生命在我们这必死的身体上显明出来(林后四11)。  


### 〖 4. 经历基督内住的生命 〗  

&emsp;1、每天用一点时间，安静坐在神面前默想，求圣灵启示你基督住在你里面的真理。求神乐意指示你，这奥秘有何等丰盛的荣耀(西一27)。  

&emsp;2、尊重你自己的身体是那位居住在里面的主之圣殿。东方人进入庙宇一定要穿鞋，西方人则要蒙头。同样的，你亦应非常谨慎，不容让任何事物玷污你的身体，或你的心灵。牲畜不可养在圣殿的院子里，让基督把它们全赶出去吧！「岂不知你们是神的殿么？神的殿是圣的，这殿就是你们。」  

&emsp;3、恨恶自己的生命。主说：「人若不爱我胜过爱自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒」(路十四26)。我们的圣经翻译为「生命」的这个字，希腊原文是「魂」。魂是自我生命的座位和中心。自我生命中那无止息的能力与活动，选择与决定，不断争取独立和领导的活动，都是由此发出的。这是我们享受住在我们里面的基督的最大拦阻。只要我们能养成对自我--不但坏的自我，好的自我也包括在内--说：「不！」的习惯；只要我们能为着基督的缘故，天天把自己交给死；只要我们愿意背起自己的十字架跟从主，甚至于死也在所不惜，我们将会格外意识到自己被那比自己的生命更丰盛、更深奥、更神圣的生命所充满了。
