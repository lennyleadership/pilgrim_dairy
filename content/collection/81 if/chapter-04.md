## Poem
若我對別人的錯誤漫不經心，  
把它們認為是平常的事：  
「哦，他們常常都是這樣的」、  
「哦，她就是這樣講話的，他就是會做出這種事…….」，  
那我就還是絲毫不懂加略山的愛。

If I find myself half-carelessly taking   
lapses for granted,  
"Oh, that’s what they always do,"  
"Oh, of course she talks like that, he acts like that,"  
then I know nothing of Calvary love.

## Meditation
     Key points: 
     1. He holds hope in us that we could turn our face to Jesus. so I need to put down our lenses, and put on Jesus's lenses.  
     2. We know ourselves what we are at different levels.  Spouses know what we are. We are stubborn.  We don't do what we suppose to do.  
     3. Without transforming our life, the quote "what would Jesus do" is just a lip service.
