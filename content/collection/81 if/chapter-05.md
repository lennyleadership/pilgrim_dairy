## Poem
若我會從取笑別人中得到樂趣；  
若我會在談話或甚至思想中奚落他人，  
那我就還是絲毫不懂加略山的愛。  

If I enjoy a joke at the expense of another;   
if I can in any way slight another in conversation, or even in thought,   
then I know nothing of Calvary love.

## Meditation
     Key points: 
 
     1. Without transforming our life, the quote "what would Jesus do" is just a lip service.  
     2. It is different from promotion of compassion at the workplace.
