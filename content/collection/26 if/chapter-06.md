## Poem
若我會寫一封無情的信，  
說出一句無情的話，  
思索一個無情的思想而不覺得羞慚與傷痛，  
那我就還是絲毫不懂加略山的愛。

If I can write an unkind letter,   
speak an unkind word,   
think an unkind thought without grief and shame,   
then I know nothing of Calvary love.  

## Meditation
     Key points: 
 
     1. Emotional intellegence.  emotional tension  is stretched inside.  The more I tried to pretend, the more tension I got.  In this process, I could build face mask.  It is not natual.  My true personal would be disclosed at difficult time.
