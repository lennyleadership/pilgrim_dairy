## Poem
If I belittle those whom I am called to serve,  
talk of their weak points  
in contrast perhaps with what I  
think of as my strong points;  

if I adopt a superior attitude,  
forgetting "who made thee to  
differ? and what hast thou that  
thou hast not received?"  
then I know nothing of Calvary love.  

若我輕看主召我來服事的那些人，  
閒話他們的缺點，  
藉此有意無意的陪襯出自己的優點；  

若我擺出一副高人一等的臉孔，  
卻忘了「使你與人不同的是誰呢？  
你有什麼不是領受的呢？」  
那我就還是絲毫不懂加略山的愛。  

## Meditation

I would like to share my meditation on Calvary love from a booklet &quot;**if**&quot;  written by Amy Carmichael.  Amy spent her life time to do the ministry to children since 1895 in India.  This booklet helped me connect Calvary love to my daily life.  I wish my meditation would help you as well in remembering Jesus.  

It is my intention to share my meditation on this booklet at the Lord's table.

I assume that you would hear such question: What would Jesus do? You tried hard to reach the high   

However, you can't do

Philippians 2:1-8

1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,   

2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.  

3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.  

4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,  

5 Or which was also in Christ Jesus  

6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,   

7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.  

8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.  

Does it leave you with frustration?  It should not.  We have Christ life in us.  That is why it is benefit for us to remember Jesus every Sunday.  I wish it would be more easier ...
