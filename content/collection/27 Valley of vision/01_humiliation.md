SOVEREIGN LORD,

<br>When clouds of darkness, atheism, and
<br>&emsp;unbelief come to me,
<br>I see thy purpose of love
<br>&emsp;in withdrawing the Spirit that I might prize him more,
<br>&emsp;in chastening me for my confidence in
<br>&emsp;past successes, that my wound of secret
<br>&emsp;godlessness might be cured.

<br><b>Help me to humble myself before thee
<br>&emsp;by seeing the vanity of honour
<br>&emsp;&emsp;as a conceit of menâ€™s minds</b>,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;as standing between me and thee;
<br>&emsp;by seeing that thy will must alone be done,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;as much in denying as in giving spiritual enjoyments;
<br>&emsp;by seeing that my heart is nothing but evil,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;mind, mouth, life void of thee;
<br>&emsp;by seeing that sin and Satan are allowed power
<br>&emsp;&emsp;in me that I might know my sin, be humbled,
<br>&emsp;and gain strength thereby;
<br>&emsp;by seeing that unbelief shuts thee from me,
<br>&emsp;&emsp;so that I sense not thy majesty, power, mercy, or love.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Then possess me, for thou only art good and worthy.

Thou dost not play in convincing me of sin,
<br>Satan did not play in tempting me to it,
<br>&emsp;I do not play when I sink in deep mire,
<br>&emsp;for sin is no game, no toy, no bauble;
<br>Let me never forget that the heinousness of sin lies
<br>&emsp;not so much in the nature of the sin committed,
<br>&emsp;as in the greatness of the Person sinned against.
<br>When I am afraid of evils to come, 
<br>&emsp;comfort me by showing me
<br>&emsp;that in myself I am a dying, condemned wretch, 
<br>&emsp;but that in Christ I am reconciled, made alive, and satisfied;
<br>&emsp;that I am feeble and unable to do any good,
<br>&emsp;but that in him I can do all things;
<br>&emsp;that what I now have in Christ is mine in part,
<br>&emsp;but shortly I shall have it perfectly in heaven.
