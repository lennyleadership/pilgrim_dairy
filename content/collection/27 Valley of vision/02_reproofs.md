O MERCIFUL GOD,

<br>When I hear of disagreeable things amongst Christians,
<br>&emsp;  it brings an additional weight and burden on my spirit;
<br>I come to thee in my distress and make lamentable complaint;
<br>Teach me how to take reproofs from friends,
<br>&emsp;  even though I think I do not deserve them;
<br>Use them to make me tenderly afraid of sin,
<br>&emsp;  more jealous over myself,
<br>&emsp;  more concerned to keep heart and life unblameable;
<br>Cause them to help me
<br>&emsp;  to reflect on my want of spirituality,
<br>&emsp;  to abhor myself,
<br>&emsp;  to look upon myself as unworthy,
<br>&emsp;  and make them beneficial to my soul.
<br>May all thy people know how little, mean, and vile I am,
<br>&emsp;  that they may see I am nothing, less than nothing,
<br>&emsp;  to be accounted nothing,
<br>&emsp;  that so they may pray for me aright,
<br>&emsp;  and have not the least dependence upon me.
<br>It is sweet to be nothing and have nothing,
<br>&emsp;  and to be fed with crumbs from thy hands.
<br>Blessed be thy Name for anything that life brings.
<br>How do poor souls live who have not thee,
<br>&emsp;  or when helpless have no God to go to,
<br>&emsp;  who feel not the constraining force of thy love,
<br>&emsp;  and the sweetness of communion?
<br>O how admirably dost thou captivate the soul,
<br>&emsp;  making all desires and affections centre on thee!
<br>Give me such vivacity in religion,
<br>&emsp;  that I may be able to take all reproofs from other men
<br>&emsp;  as from thy hands,
<br>&emsp;  and glorify thee for them from a sense of thy beneficent love
<br>&emsp;  and of my need to have my pride destroyed.
