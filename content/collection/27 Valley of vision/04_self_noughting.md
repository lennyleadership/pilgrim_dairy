O LORD,

<u class = "red">Help me to approach thee</u>
<br>&emsp;  with becoming conception of thy nature, relations and designs.
<br>Thou inhabitest eternity, and my life is nothing before thee;
<br>Thou dwellest in the highest heaven and
<br>&emsp;  this cannot contain thee; I live in a house of clay.
<br>Thy power is almighty; I am crushed before the moth.
<br>Thy understanding is infinite;
<br>&emsp;   I know nothing as I ought to know.
<br>Thou canst not behold evil; I am vile.
<br>In my ignorance, weakness, fears, depressions,
<br>&emsp;  may thy Spirit help my infirmities
<br>&emsp;    with supplies of wisdom, strength and comfort.
<br>&emsp;Let me faithfully study my character,
<br>&emsp;  be willing to bring it to light,
<br>&emsp;  observe myself in my trials,
<br>&emsp;  judge the reality and degree of my grace,
<br>&emsp;  consider how I have been ensnared or overcome.
<br>Grant that I may never trust my heart,
<br>&emsp;  depend upon any past experiences,
<br>&emsp;  magnify any present resolutions,
<br>&emsp;  but be strong in the grace of Jesus:
<br>&emsp;  that I may know how to obtain relief from a guilty conscience
<br>&emsp;  without feeling reconciled to my imperfections.
<br>Sustain me under my trials and improve them to me;
<br>&emsp;  give me grace to rest in thee, and assure me of deliverance.
<br>May I always combine thy majesty with thy mercy,
<br>&emsp;  and connect thy goodness with thy greatness.
<br>Then shall my heart always rejoice in praises to thee.
