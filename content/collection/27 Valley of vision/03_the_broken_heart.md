O LORD,

No day of my life has passed that has not proved me guilty in thy sight.
<br>Prayers have been uttered from a prayerless heart;
<br>Praise has been often praiseless sound;
<br>My best services are filthy rags.

Blessed Jesus, let me find a covert in thy appeasing wounds.
<br>Though my sins rise to heaven thy merits soar above them;
<br>Though unrighteousness weighs me down to hell,
<br>&emsp;  thy righteousness exalts me to thy throne.
<br>&emsp;All things in me call for my rejection,
<br>&emsp;All things in thee plead my acceptance.

I appeal from the throne of perfect justice
<br>&emsp;  to thy throne of boundless grace.
<br>Grant me to hear thy voice assuring me:
<br>&emsp;  that by thy stripes I am healed,
<br>&emsp;  that thou wast bruised for my iniquities,
<br>&emsp;  that thou hast been made sin for me
<br>&emsp;  that I might be righteous in thee,
<br>&emsp;  that my grievous sins, my manifold sins, are all forgiven,
<br>&emsp;  buried in the ocean of thy concealing blood.

I am guilty, but pardoned,
<br>&emsp;  lost, but saved,
<br>&emsp;  wandering, but found,
<br>&emsp;  sinning, but cleansed.
<br>Give me perpetual broken-heartedness,
<br>Keep me always clinging to thy cross,
<br>Flood me every moment with descending grace,
<br>Open to me the springs of divine knowledge,
<br>&emsp;  sparkling like crystal,
<br>&emsp;  flowing clear and unsullied through my wilderness of life.
